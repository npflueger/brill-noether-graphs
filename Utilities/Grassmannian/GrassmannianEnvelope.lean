# The remaining negative-side Grassmannian envelope

`GrassmannianAsp` proves that the ordinary Young-diagram corners dominate all
rows with `b ≥ 0`.  This module isolates the complementary half without
silently replacing it by a finite experiment.  The only extra datum is the
cardinality of a finite interval of *negative* inputs; for a Grassmannian
permutation its membership predicate is the explicit column-length formula.

The Young-diagram counting inequality is proved below, so the resulting
corner envelope and once-marked dictionary are unconditional facts about the
explicitly reconstructed ASP permutation.
