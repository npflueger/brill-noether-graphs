# Grassmannian transmission existence: the universal interface

`GrassmannianTransmissionExistence` and its equivalence with the once-marked
Brill--Noether statement, rehomed from `GrassmannianLowGenus.lean` (which
imports this file and keeps the genus-bounded consequences) so that the
genus-generic transmission layer does not depend on the low-genus census.

/-- Every shifted Grassmannian transmission problem allowed by the genus has
a witness.  The second mark is retained because it belongs to the
transmission presentation, although the Grassmannian locus depends only on
the first mark up to existence. -/
