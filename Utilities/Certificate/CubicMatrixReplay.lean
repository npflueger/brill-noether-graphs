# A row-by-row replay tree for loopless regular multiplicity matrices

A finite classifier for loopless regular cores can work with the unordered
vertex-pair multiplicity table.  This module supplies its generic
*completeness* device: a compact finite witness that some displayed list of
tables exhausts every table which can arise.

This module is that device, and nothing else.  It defines

* `boundedCompositions`, the weak compositions of one remaining degree into
  the capacities of the still-unvisited vertices;
* `Follows`, the statement that a list of strict-upper-triangular rows is
  produced by the row-by-row branching;
* `ReplayTree`, a fuelled sibling-chain tree whose branches are keyed by
  those compositions, with a Boolean checker `validCheck`;
* `rowsOf` / `entryOf`, the translation between a multiplicity matrix and its
  row list, and `matrixOf`, the multiplicity matrix of an ordered core;
* `MatrixConnected`, the decidable cut form of
  `ExplicitPotential.Core.Connected` read off the table.

The two results that matter are `validCheck_sound` — a tree passing the
Boolean check accepts *every* row list produced by the branching — and
`follows_capsOf_rowsOf` — every symmetric, zero-diagonal, constant-row-sum
matrix does follow the branching.  Exhaustiveness is proved from the
weak-composition membership characterization `mem_boundedCompositions`; there
is no `native_decide`, no `decide` over endpoint functions, and no search.

Nothing here is specific to eight vertices or to degree three.  The vertex
count and the common degree are parameters, so one generated tree shape serves
the genus-four (`6/9`) and genus-five (`8/12`) classifiers.

Disconnected tables satisfy the same row-sum conditions and therefore also
reach a leaf.  A generated leaf may carry no atlas target for those; the
decoding hypothesis of the composed statements only fires on tables satisfying
`MatrixConnected`.

This is the generic checker side only.  Application-specific datasets, leaf
decoders, and classifier handoff theorems belong in their application layer.

/-! ## The branching relation -/

/-- `Follows capacities rows` says that `rows` is the strict-upper-triangular
row list of a matrix built by the row-by-row completion, starting from the
residual degree vector `capacities`.  The head capacity is the remaining
degree of the current vertex; the chosen row is a capacity-bounded weak
composition of it, and the tail capacities are decreased accordingly. -/

/-! ## The replay tree -/

/-- A fuelled row-by-row completion tree.  `branch` stores the composition
that keys this child together with the child itself and the next sibling, so
the sibling chain at one vertex is spelled out linearly; `reject` terminates a
sibling chain, and `accept` carries the payload of a completed matrix. -/
inductive ReplayTree (α : Type*) where
  | accept : α → ReplayTree α
  | reject : ReplayTree α
  | branch : List ℕ → ReplayTree α → ReplayTree α → ReplayTree α

/-- Check one sibling chain against the list `todo` of compositions it must
cover.  The chain must list them in exactly the enumeration order of
`boundedCompositions`; `sub` checks each child against the decreased
capacities and the extended path. -/

  | _, _ :: _ => false

/-- The Boolean replay check.  `fuel` bounds the number of vertices still to
be visited, `capacities` is the residual degree vector, and `path` records the
rows chosen so far.  At a completed matrix the caller-supplied `leafCheck`
inspects the path and the stored payload; at an unfinished vertex the tree
must be a sibling chain covering every capacity-bounded weak composition of
the head capacity. -/

/-! ## Connectedness at the level of the table

Disconnected matrices also satisfy `Conditions` and therefore also follow the
branching, so the tree must reach them too.  A generated leaf is allowed to
carry no atlas target in that case; the decoding hypothesis below is only
required to fire on connected tables.  `MatrixConnected` is the cut form of
`ExplicitPotential.Core.Connected` transported to the multiplicity table. -/

/-- Cut connectedness of a multiplicity table on the vertex range.  Cuts range
over `(Finset.range size).powerset` rather than over all of `Finset ℕ`, so the
predicate is decidable and a generated leaf record may discharge it by
evaluation. -/
