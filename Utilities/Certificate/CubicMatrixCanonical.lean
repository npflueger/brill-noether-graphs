# Canonical branch pruning for the cubic matrix replay

`Certificate/CubicMatrixExhaustive.lean` removed the generated tree, leaving
the leaf payloads as the whole remaining cost.  This module supplies the
machinery to cut those down, and to cut the traversal down with them.

Everything here is generic in the vertex count and the degree.  That is
deliberate: the genus-four instance at `n = 6` is a proof of concept for the
genus-five instance at `n = 8`, where the numbers are

```text
            connected leaves   + cut 0   + cut 0 and cut 1
n = 6                    640        46                  20
n = 8                168,840     4,470                 777
```

## The two cuts

A node's state is really `(S, residual capacity on V \ S)` with `S` the set of
processed vertices; the row-by-row scheme is the special case where `S` is a
prefix.  The freedom to choose which vertex to process next is exactly the
freedom to *sort by relabeling*, and that gives two cuts:

* **cut 0** — relabel `1 … n-1` so that row `0` is ascending;
* **cut 1** — then, within each maximal block of positions sharing a row-`0`
  value, relabel so that row `1` is ascending.  Such a permutation moves
  vertices only inside row-`0` level sets, so it preserves cut 0.

Both are witnessed by explicit permutations, so no canonical labeling happens
inside Lean.

Ascending is deliberate and is worth about 25 per cent over descending: cut 1
does not move position `1`, and ascending puts the smallest row-`0` value
there, leaving larger blocks for cut 1 to act on.

## What is here and what is not

`canonicalPrefix` is the decidable predicate, `prunedCheck` is the traversal
that skips non-canonical branches, and `prunedCheck_sound` is its soundness.
Because the predicate only inspects rows `0` and `1`, it is decided as soon as
those are chosen, so the pruning happens at the top of the tree where it saves
the most.

The remaining obligation is named `CanonicalRepresentative`: every candidate is
isomorphic to a canonical one.  **It is stated here and not proved.**  Its
empirical form was checked at `n = 6`, where the 20 canonical connected leaves
carry all six atlas indices; see
the accompanying analysis.
