# Orientability of degree `g - 1` divisor classes

An–Baker–Kuperberg–Shokrieh, *Canonical representatives for divisor classes on tropical
curves and the matrix–tree theorem*, calls a divisor `D` **orientable** when
`D(p) = indeg_𝒪(p) - 1` for some orientation `𝒪`, and proves (Theorem 1.2,
arXiv:1304.4259) that **every divisor of
degree `g - 1` is linearly equivalent to an orientable one**.  This file proves
the finite-multigraph form in `orientable_of_deg_eq` and
`orientable_iff_deg_eq`.

## Parallel edges

`CFOrientation` is a `count_preserving` flow-count vector representing an
arbitrary edge-level orientation. Parallel edges may therefore be oriented
independently, and no simplicity hypothesis is required.

## The two halves, and how each is proved

The classes split by winnability, and the two halves are proved by unrelated arguments:

* **Unwinnable classes are orientable** — by an *acyclic* orientation. This is
  `orientable_of_not_winnable` below, a corollary of `unwinnable_iff_exists_acyclic_ordiv`
  (`Foundations/AcyclicOrientation.lean`). It was the one statement here that never needed
  simplicity even under the old model, because two parallel edges pointing opposite ways are
  themselves a directed `2`-cycle, so `no_bidirectional` discarded no acyclic orientation.
* **Winnable classes need a cyclic orientation**, and are reached by the ABKS route of §3.
  `orientable_of_forall_winnable` records the reduction to them, but it is no longer needed
  for the main theorem: §3 proves all degree-`(g−1)` classes at once.

## The ABKS route, as formalized in §3

The source's argument has two steps, and both are proved here.

1. **Hakimi's criterion** (`\label{thm:orient}`, line 744): a divisor of degree `g − 1` with
   `χ(S, D) ≥ 0` for every nonempty `S` *is* an orientation divisor, where
   `χ(S,D) = deg(D|_S) + |S| − e(S)`. Here `exists_ordiv_eq_of_chi_nonneg`.

   ABKS obtain this from max-flow/min-cut.  Section 3c takes an elementary route instead:
   with `d v = D v + 1` the target in-degree, orient the edges one
   at a time (`exists_isOrientationOf`, induction on the edge multiset), decrementing `d` at
   the head. Some direction of the chosen edge always keeps Hakimi's inequality
   `e(S) ≤ ∑_{v ∈ S} d v` alive, because a tight set separating `b` from `a` and a tight set
   separating `a` from `b` would make the cross term `e(S∖T, T∖S)` of the submodularity
   refinement both zero and at least one — the edge `ab` sits inside it. No flow theory, and
   no simplicity: `CFOrientation` is now the edge-level orientation type, so an orientation
   built edge by edge packages directly.

2. **The submodularity descent** (`\label{thm:eqiv_orient}`, line 758): every degree-`(g−1)`
   divisor is linearly equivalent to one satisfying (1). Here `exists_linear_equiv_chi_nonneg`.

   `χ(·, D)` is submodular, with the quantitative refinement
   `χ(S,D) + χ(T,D) = χ(S∪T,D) + χ(S∩T,D) + e(S∖T, T∖S)` (`eulerChi_add_eulerChi`), so its
   minimizers are closed under `∩` and `∪` (`eulerChi_inter_union_eq_chiMin`) and there is a
   minimal one, `chiMinimizer G D` (`chiMinimizer_subset`). Firing its complement raises
   every `χ(S, ·)` above `χ_D`, with equality only for `S ⊋ S₀`
   (`chiMin_le_eulerChi_set_firing`).

   ABKS then argue that the loop terminates. The formalization replaces the loop by its fixed
   point: `chiPotential = χ_D · (|V| + 1) + |S₀|` is bounded above by `|V|` and strictly
   increases at each step, so the divisor of greatest potential in the class — which exists by
   `Int.exists_greatest_of_bdd` — must already have `χ_D ≥ 0`. No well-founded recursion is
   needed.

Everything in §3a–§3b (`edgesWithinOf`, `edgesBetweenOf`, `numEdgesOf`, `edgesBetween` and
their identities) is stated for an *arbitrary* edge multiset, because step (1) removes edges;
`G.edges` is substituted only at the end.

/-! ## 1. `Orientable`, and the trivial facts -/

/-- **A divisor class is orientable** when it contains the divisor of some orientation.

This is An–Baker–Kuperberg–Shokrieh's "linearly equivalent to an orientable divisor"; the
linear equivalence is built into the predicate because that is the form every consumer wants.
Since `CFOrientation` lost its `no_bidirectional` field it is the set of edge-level
orientations of `G`, multigraphs included, so this predicate now agrees with ABKS's
everywhere and not merely on simple graphs. -/

  ∃ O : CFOrientation G, linear_equiv G D (ordiv G O)

`unwinnable_iff_exists_acyclic_ordiv` this is exactly unwinnability at degree `genus G - 1`

/-! ## 2. The unwinnable half, which is already done

This section never needed a simplicity hypothesis, even under the old restricted model:
`no_bidirectional` discarded no *acyclic* orientation, because two parallel edges pointing
opposite ways form a directed `2`-cycle. -/

/-- **Acyclic orientability is unwinnability**, at degree `genus G - 1`. A restatement of

  (unwinnable_iff_exists_acyclic_ordiv h_conn D hDeg).symm

/-- **Every unwinnable class of degree `genus G - 1` is orientable, by an acyclic
orientation.**

This is the half of ABKS Theorem 1.2 that a *cyclic* orientation is never needed for, and it
predates the ABKS route of §3, which now proves every degree-`(g−1)` class. It is kept
because it says more than `orientable_of_deg_eq` does on unwinnable classes: the witnessing
orientation is acyclic. -/

/-- **The decomposition, made explicit.** To orient every degree-`(g−1)` class it suffices to
orient the *winnable* ones; the unwinnable ones are already done by
`orientable_of_not_winnable`.

This was the reduction §2c was attacked through while the winnable case was open; §3 has
since closed that case, so the lemma is no longer on the path to `orientable_of_deg_eq`. It
still records why the winnable case was the hard one: such a class is by
`isAcyclic_iff_not_winnable_ordiv` (`Foundations/OrientationReversal.lean`) never the divisor
of an acyclic orientation, so any witness for it must be cyclic, and cyclic orientations were
precisely what `CFOrientation.no_bidirectional` failed to represent on a multigraph. -/

vertex set, `χ` measures the deviation of `deg D` from `genus G - 1`. -/

/-! ## 3a. Edge counts, on an arbitrary edge multiset

Hakimi's criterion is proved below by induction on the edge multiset, so both counting
functions are introduced for an arbitrary `M : Multiset (G.V × G.V)` and specialised to
`G.edges` afterwards (`edgesWithin_eq`, `numEdgesOf_edges`). `Multiset.countP` rather than
`Multiset.card ∘ Multiset.filter` is the working form: `countP_cons` is exactly the induction
step, and the whole layer is then arithmetic. -/

/-! ## 3c. Hakimi's criterion, by induction on the edge multiset

The classical proof of `\label{thm:orient}` goes through max-flow/min-cut. The
route taken here is elementary: orient the edges one at
a time, maintaining Hakimi's inequality for the remaining multiset. The only thing that has to
be checked is that *some* direction of the chosen edge keeps the inequality, and that is
exactly `edgesWithinOf_add_edgesWithinOf`: if a tight set separated `b` from `a` **and**
another tight set separated `a` from `b`, the cross term `e(S∖T, T∖S)` would be both `0` and
`≥ 1`, the edge `ab` itself sitting inside it.

`G.edges` is substituted only at the very end. -/

/-- **Hakimi's criterion** (`Picg_revised.tex:744`, `\label{thm:orient}`): a divisor of degree
`genus G - 1` all of whose `χ(S, ·)` are nonnegative *is* an orientation divisor — on the
nose, not merely up to linear equivalence.

**No simplicity hypothesis, since 2026-08-20.** This is where the old model defect lived and
where the hypothesis was consumed: the classical statement produces an edge-level orientation,
and packaging one as a `CFOrientation` used to require that no parallel class be split — on
the 5-banana the divisor `(1, 2)` satisfies the criterion and was not `ordiv` of any
`CFOrientation`. With `no_bidirectional` removed, `CFOrientation` *is* the edge-level
orientation type, `(1, 2)` is realised, and the classical statement transcribes verbatim.

ABKS cite Hakimi, Schrijver Thm 61.1 and Backman Thm 7.3, and note that the statement is
equivalent to max-flow/min-cut; no flow theory is used here. The proof is
`exists_isOrientationOf`, the edge-by-edge greedy orientation, applied to `G.edges` with
target in-degree `d v = D v + 1`. The hypothesis enters twice: at `S = {v}` it says
`D v + 1 ≥ 0`, so `d` is a well-defined natural number, and at general `S` it is exactly
Hakimi's inequality `e(S) ≤ ∑_{v ∈ S} d v`. `deg D = genus G - 1` is what makes `∑ d` the
number of edges. -/

/-! ## 3f. One descent step

`ABKS`'s Claim (`Picg_revised.tex:772`): firing the complement of `S₀(D)` produces a divisor
whose `χ` is everywhere `≥ χ_D`, with equality only on sets strictly containing `S₀(D)`. The
proof below merges their four cases into two — `S ⊆ S₀` and `S ⊄ S₀` — which is legitimate
because the empty intersection is not a special case once `χ(∅, ·) = 0 ≥ χ_D` is available. -/

/-- **ABKS's Claim.** With `S₀ = S₀(D)` and `D₁` obtained from `D` by firing `S₀ᶜ`, every
`χ(S, D₁)` is at least `χ_D`, and equals it only when `S ⊋ S₀`.

Connectivity is used exactly once, in the case `S = S₀`: it makes `e(S₀ᶜ, S₀) > 0`, which is
what turns that case's inequality into a strict one. -/

No simplicity hypothesis: this step never mentions orientations, only `eulerChi` and set
firing.

ABKS run the descent as a loop and argue that it terminates. Here the loop is replaced by its
fixed point: `chiPotential` is bounded above by `|V|`, so among all divisors in the class
there is one of greatest potential (`Int.exists_greatest_of_bdd`), and `chiPotential_lt` says
that a divisor with `χ_D < 0` is never of greatest potential. Hence the maximiser has
`χ_D ≥ 0`, which is Hakimi's criterion. -/

/-- **ABKS Theorem 1.2.** On a connected graph, simple or not, every divisor
of degree `genus G - 1` is linearly equivalent to `ordiv G O` for some orientation `O`.

The simplicity hypothesis this theorem used to carry (it was called
`orientable_of_deg_eq_of_simple`) was an artefact of `CFOrientation.no_bidirectional` and has
been deleted with it; see the module docstring.

Proved by composing the two halves of the ABKS route: `exists_linear_equiv_chi_nonneg` (the
submodularity descent) moves the class to a representative satisfying Hakimi's criterion, and
`exists_ordiv_eq_of_chi_nonneg` (Hakimi) turns that representative into an orientation on the
nose. The unwinnable case also has an independent proof with an *acyclic* witness — see
`orientable_of_not_winnable`. -/
