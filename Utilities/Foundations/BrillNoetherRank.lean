# The Brill--Noether rank of a finite graph

Lim, Payne and Potashnik introduced the **Brill--Noether rank** `w^r_d` of a
metric graph as a well-behaved substitute for `dim W^r_d`, which is *not*
upper semicontinuous on the moduli space of metric graphs
(arXiv:1106.5519, Definition 3.1):

> `w^r_d(Γ)` is the largest integer `k` such that, for every effective divisor
> `E` of degree `r + k`, there exists a divisor `D` of degree `d` and rank at
> least `r` on `Γ` such that `D - E` is effective.  If `W^r_d(Γ)` is empty,
> `w^r_d(Γ)` is `-1`.

Len extended the definition to weighted tropical curves and proved upper
semicontinuity there (arXiv:1209.6309, §6).  Both papers prove a
specialization inequality `dim W^r_d(X) ≤ w^r_d(Γ)`, from which LPP deduce
`w^r_d(Γ) ≥ min {ρ(g,r,d), g}` for *every* metric graph — by transfer from
algebraic geometry, never combinatorially.

This file records the **discrete** analogue, in which both `E` and `D` are
supported on the vertices of a finite graph.  Note the degree bookkeeping:
`w^r_d ≥ k` tests effective divisors of degree `r + k`, not `k`.  Consequently

* `w^r_d(G) ≥ 0` is *exactly* Brill--Noether existence (`bnRankGe_zero_iff_bnExists`):
  a single divisor of rank at least `r` already absorbs every effective divisor
  of degree `r`, by the definition of rank.  Nothing is gained at `k = 0`.
* `w^r_d(G) ≥ 1` is genuinely more.  It splits into a *ramification* half
  (`E = 2•v`) and a *secant* half (`E = v + w`, `v ≠ w`), and neither half
  implies the other in general.

Besides the definition and its basic reformulations, this file proves that the
predicate is downward closed in `k` (`bnRankGe_of_le`), that it fails once the
degree drops below `r + k` (`not_bnRankGe_of_lt`), and that it is invariant
under an adjacency-preserving relabeling of vertices
(`Certificate.LaplacianEquiv.bnRankGe_iff`).  These combine into the numerical
invariant `bnRank`, normalized as in Len to be `-1` when `W^r_d` is empty.

The descent of this predicate along an odd subdivision lives in
`Utilities/Subdivision/SubdivisionChipDescent.lean` and is not imported here.

/-! ## The definition -/

/-- `BNRankGe G r d k` is the discrete Brill--Noether rank inequality
`w^r_d(G) ≥ k` of Lim--Payne--Potashnik and Len: every effective divisor `E` of
degree `r + k` is contained, up to linear equivalence, in a divisor of degree
`d` and rank at least `r`.

The literature says "`E` is contained in an effective divisor `D` of degree `d`
and rank at least `r`"; since rank is a class invariant, that is the same as
asking for `D - E` to be winnable, which is the form stated here.  The
containment form is recovered by `bnRankGe_iff_contained`. -/

/-! ## The rank-zero case is exactly Brill--Noether existence -/

/-- **The `k = 0` case is not new information.**  `w^r_d(G) ≥ 0` says that
every effective divisor of degree `r` can be absorbed, and that is precisely
the definition of a divisor of rank at least `r`.  So the Brill--Noether rank
inequality at `k = 0` is equivalent to plain Brill--Noether existence. -/

residual of `E'`, which differs from it by an effective divisor.

The hypothesis `0 ≤ r + k'` is not needed — below that range the statement is
vacuous, since there are no effective divisors of negative degree — but it is
kept in the interface, as every intended use supplies it. -/
