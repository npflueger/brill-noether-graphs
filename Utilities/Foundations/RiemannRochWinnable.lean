# Degree-specialized Riemann--Roch and winnability

For a divisor of degree `g - 1 + k`, graph Riemann--Roch says that the rank
condition `rank D ≥ k` is exactly winnability of the canonical complement
`K - D`.  This is the form used repeatedly by residual-chip and
common-complement arguments, where the degree bookkeeping is fixed before the
rank condition is applied.
