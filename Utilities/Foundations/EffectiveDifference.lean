# The effective-difference lemma

For a connected graph of genus `g ≥ 2`, every degree-zero divisor class `γ` is
the difference `F - E` of two effective divisors `E, F` of degree `g - 1`.

Equivalently, the two effective loci satisfy
`W_{g-1} ∩ (W_{g-1} - γ) ≠ ∅` in the finite graph Jacobian.  The formulation
below is purely in terms of divisors and linear equivalence.

## Proof sketch

Write `K` for `canonical_divisor G` and `g` for `genus G`.

1. `rank G γ ≥ -1` always, and `g ≥ 2` forces `-1 ≥ 1 - g`, so
   `rank G γ ≥ 1 - g`.  Since `deg γ = 0 = (g - 1) + (1 - g)`, Riemann--Roch
   (`rank_ge_iff_exists_effective_canonical_complement`) turns this rank bound
   into an effective representative `M` of `K - γ`; `deg M = 2g - 2`.
2. Split `M` into effective `E, F*` with `deg E = deg F* = g - 1`
   (`effective_divisor_decomposition`, already in `ChipFiringWithLean.Basic`).
3. `F*` is effective, hence winnable, so by the degree-`(g-1)` self-duality
   (`degree_genus_sub_one_winnable_iff_complement_winnable`) its canonical
   complement `K - F*` is winnable too; let `F` be an effective representative.
4. `F - E ~ (K - F*) - E = K - (E + F*) = K - M ~ K - (K - γ) = γ`.
