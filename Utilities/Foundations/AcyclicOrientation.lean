# Unwinnability at degree `g - 1` and acyclic orientations

For a connected graph `G` and a divisor `D` of degree `genus G - 1`, the main
result `unwinnable_iff_exists_acyclic_ordiv` identifies unwinnability with
linear equivalence to `ordiv G O` for an acyclic orientation `O`.

The proof assembles the following results from `chip-firing-with-lean`:

* `ordiv`, `is_acyclic`, `acyclic_with_unique_source`, `orientation_to_config`
  (`Orientation.lean:402,221,357,431`) — the definitions.
* `ordiv_unwinnable` (`Orientation.lean:666`) — acyclic ⟹ `ordiv` unwinnable. This alone is
  the `⟸` direction, after transporting along `linear_equiv` with `winnable_equiv_winnable`
  (`Rank.lean:32`).
* `config_and_divisor_from_O` (`Orientation.lean:449`) and `div_of_config_of_div`
  (`Config.lean:161`) — together they give, for any acyclic `O` with unique source `q`,
  `(orientation_to_config G O q hO).chips - one_chip q = ordiv G O`
  (`orientation_config_sub_one_chip_eq_ordiv` below). This is the bridge from the
  configuration side back to the orientation divisor.
* `maximal_superstable_orientation` (`Orientation.lean:1186`) — every maximal superstable
  configuration comes from an acyclic orientation with unique source `q` (Dhar's algorithm,
  via `superstable_dhar` at `Orientation.lean:1118`).
* `maximal_unwinnable_char` (`RRGHelpers.lean:329`) — a divisor is maximal unwinnable iff its
  `q`-reduced representative has the shape `c - q` for `c` the (maximal superstable)
  `q`-reduced configuration.
* `winnable_of_deg_ge_genus` (`RRGHelpers.lean:223`) — an unwinnable divisor
  of degree `g - 1` is maximal unwinnable, since adding one chip gives degree
  `g` and therefore a winnable divisor.
* `unique_q_reduced` (`Basic.lean:1497`) — existence and uniqueness of the `q`-reduced
  representative, used to recover `linear_equiv G D (qReducedRep h_conn q D)` (the spec
  lemma for `qReducedRep` is `private` to `RRGHelpers.lean`, so it is re-derived here in one
  line from the public `unique_q_reduced`).

/-- The canonical `q`-reduced representative of `D` is linearly equivalent to `D`.

/-- For an acyclic orientation `O` with unique source `q`, the associated configuration minus
one chip at `q` recovers the orientation divisor `ordiv G O`.

This is the identity underlying `q_reduced_eq_chips_sub_one_chip` specialized to the
orientation-divisor case, proved the same way `moderator_of_unwinnable`
(`RRGHelpers.lean:443`) proves its `h_M_O` step: convert `orientation_to_config` to
`toConfig (orqed O hO)` via `config_and_divisor_from_O`, then use that `toDiv` at degree
`genus G - 1` of a configuration of degree `genus G` (`config_degree_from_O`) is exactly
`chips - one_chip q`. -/

/-- **The hard direction, assembled.** An unwinnable divisor of degree `genus G - 1` is
linearly equivalent to the orientation divisor of some acyclic orientation.

Chain: unwinnable of degree `g-1` is maximal unwinnable (`winnable_of_deg_ge_genus`, the one
new step); `maximal_unwinnable_char` reads off that the `q`-reduced representative is
`c - q` for `c` the maximal superstable `q`-reduced configuration;
`maximal_superstable_orientation` produces an acyclic `O` with unique source `q` realizing
`c`; `orientation_config_sub_one_chip_eq_ordiv` identifies `c - q` with `ordiv G O`. -/

for some acyclic orientation `O`.

Pairs with `Utilities.Certificate.ExplicitPotential.onFacet_flipPoint_iff_runsAgainst`
in `OrientationPoint.lean`, which reads the same equivalence off the geometric side: a
circuit is tight at the orientation's theta witness exactly when the orientation has a
directed cycle, i.e. is not acyclic. -/
