# Canonical slack pairs

On a connected graph of genus at least three, split an effective
representative of `K - (x) - (y)` into equal halves.  Restoring the two marked
chips produces complementary degree-`g`, rank-one divisors, each of which
remains winnable after removing the marked pair.

The declarations use the established `MarkedGraphs` namespace for API
compatibility.
