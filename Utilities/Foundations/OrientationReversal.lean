# The orientation reversal calculus

This file develops reversal of sets of edges of a `CFOrientation`, the two
fundamental moves given by directed cycles and directed cuts, and Gioan's
theorem relating reversal classes to linear equivalence of orientation
divisors.

## Contents

1. `reverseOn` — reverse every edge whose directed pair satisfies a predicate, with the
   `flow` and `indeg` bookkeeping (`flow_reverseOn`, `indeg_reverseOn`). This is the *coarse*
   move: a predicate on vertex pairs can only turn a whole parallel class at once.
2. `DirectedCycle`, and the two cycle reversals.
   * `reverseCycle` (coarse) turns the whole parallel class at each step.
     `indeg_reverseCycle_vert` and `indeg_reverseCycle_of_notMem` are its exact bookkeeping;
     `ordiv_reverseCycle` gives *equality* of `ordiv` only under a balance hypothesis, and
     `ordiv_reverseCycle_of_simple` discharges that hypothesis for simple graphs.
   * `reverseCycleOne` (fine) turns exactly one edge at each step — the classical move. It
     preserves every in-degree unconditionally (`indeg_reverseCycleOne`), hence `ordiv`
     (`ordiv_reverseCycleOne`).
   `DirectedCycle.reversed` / `.reversedOne` say the reversed cycle is again a directed
   cycle, so "has a directed cycle" survives either reversal.
3. `eq_of_indeg_eq_of_isAcyclic` — the strengthened uniqueness: if `O` is acyclic and
   `indeg O = indeg O'` pointwise then `O = O'`. `isAcyclic_iff_unique_of_indeg` packages
   it as "an orientation is acyclic iff it is the *unique* orientation with its indegree
   function", where the `←` direction assumes only that `O` has no directed `2`-cycle.
4. `isAcyclic_reverseCut` — reversing a directed cut takes acyclic orientations to acyclic
   ones.
5. `ReversalStep` / `ReversalEquiv`, `isAcyclic_of_reversalEquiv`, and
   `gioan_reversalEquiv_of_linear_equiv` — **Gioan's theorem, proved**. Its two halves are
   `reversalEquiv_of_indeg_eq` (the fine cycle move handles a difference of divergence zero)
   and `reversalEquiv_of_potential` (the cut move handles the rest); `diffFlow` is the signed
   difference vector both of them read, and `isDirectedCut_compl_of_min` is the one real
   idea — see the header of "Step 2" below.
6. `winnable_ordiv_of_not_isAcyclic` and `isAcyclic_iff_not_winnable_ordiv`,
   derived from 2+4+5 and `unwinnable_iff_exists_acyclic_ordiv`.

The path combinatorics is confined to `exists_isChain_of_backward_step`: a nonempty set of
vertices each of which is the head of an edge from another member forces arbitrarily long
chains, hence a repeat. It is used three times, for 2, for 3, and for 5.

## The edge-level orientation model

`CFOrientation` used to carry a field `no_bidirectional` forbidding two parallel edges to
point in opposite directions, so an orientation in that model turned each parallel class as a
block. Dependency pin `4f06d84` removed it; `CFOrientation` is now an arbitrary edge-level
orientation, i.e. any flow-count vector satisfying `count_preserving`. Three consequences,
all of them realised in this file:

* **`DirectedCycle` now allows two vertices** (`Fin (len + 2)`, not `Fin (len + 3)`): a
  parallel class with one edge each way *is* a directed `2`-cycle. Only looplessness rules
  out one-vertex cycles. Both `reverseCycle_ne` and `reverseCycleOne_ne` consequently need
  `1 ≤ C.len`: on a `2`-cycle the coarse move swaps the two flow counts and the fine move
  removes and restores one unit each way, so both can return `O` itself.
* **The fine cycle reversal exists**, and it is what makes `ordiv` preservation
  unconditional. The old "multi-edge caveat" — cycle reversal changes indegrees by the class
  multiplicity, so `ordiv_reverseCycle` needs a balance hypothesis — applies to the coarse
  move only, and the coarse move is now a curiosity rather than the only option.
* **`isAcyclic_iff_unique_of_indeg` no longer needs simplicity**, only the absence of a
  directed `2`-cycle; see its docstring for why that residue is not removable.

class; see the module docstring for which one is load-bearing where. -/

has one vertex. Two-vertex cycles (`len = 0`) are genuine and must be allowed — a parallel
class with one edge each way is a directed 2-cycle, which the `CFOrientation` model
represents since `no_bidirectional` was removed from the dependency. The bound was `+ 3`

`DirectedCycle O` is the case `R = directed_edge G O` of `RelCycle R`. The generality is
needed exactly once, and it is essential there: `reversalEquiv_of_indeg_eq` finds its cycle
in the relation "`O₁` carries strictly more flow than `O₂`", which is *smaller* than
`directed_edge G O₁`, and the extra information — that every step of the cycle is a step
where the two orientations disagree — is what makes the flow bookkeeping close. -/

`f c = f (c + (m + 1))` of the chain. Minimality makes `f c, …, f (c + m)` pairwise distinct —
a shorter repeat inside that window would be a shorter gap — so they are the vertices of a
cycle, closed up by `f (c + (m + 1)) = f c`. The gap is at least `2`, because irreflexivity
of `R` kills gap `1` — and that is the only exclusion needed, since `RelCycle` (like
`DirectedCycle`) allows two-vertex cycles.

turns the whole class each way at once, i.e. it *swaps* `flow O u v` with `flow O v u`, so on
a `2`-banana oriented one edge each way it gives back exactly `O`. With three or more

/-! ### The fine cycle reversal

`reverseCycle` turns a whole parallel class at every step of the cycle, because `reverseOn`
sees only the vertex pair. `reverseCycleOne` turns exactly **one** edge at every step, which
is the classical cycle-reversal move of the orientation calculus. It became representable
only when `no_bidirectional` was removed from `CFOrientation`: splitting a parallel class is
precisely what that field forbade. Unlike the coarse move it preserves `indeg`, and hence
`ordiv`, with no hypothesis at all. -/

`orientation_determined_by_indegrees` in the dependency requires *both* orientations to be
acyclic. Only one of them is really needed, and the proof of the dependency's lemma in fact
never uses the second hypothesis — but the hypothesis is in its statement, so the stronger
form is re-proved here from `not_isAcyclic_of_backward_step`.

The mathematical content: the signed set of edges on which `O` and `O'` disagree is a
circulation (it preserves every indegree), so following disagreements backwards never
terminates, which an acyclic `O` forbids. -/

/-- **An orientation is acyclic iff it is the unique orientation with its indegree
function** — the clean restatement of `eq_of_indeg_eq_of_isAcyclic`.

`→` is unconditional. `←` needs a hypothesis, and the hypothesis is exactly **"`O` has no
directed 2-cycle"** — strictly weaker than the simplicity hypothesis this theorem used to
carry, and not removable:

* it is *sufficient* because a non-acyclic `O` then carries a directed cycle on at least
  three vertices, and the fine cycle reversal `reverseCycleOne` produces a different
  orientation with the same in-degrees (`indeg_reverseCycleOne`, `reverseCycleOne_ne`);
* it is *necessary* because on the `3`-banana the orientation with two edges `u → v` and one
  edge `v → u` has in-degrees `(1, 2)`, and no other orientation of that graph does — the
  three edges must split `(2, 1)` — yet it is cyclic. Note that both cycle reversals are
  useless here: reversing the `2`-cycle finely takes one edge out of each direction and puts
  one back, and coarsely swaps the two counts, which changes the in-degrees.

Simplicity was the right hypothesis only while `CFOrientation.no_bidirectional` forced cycle
reversal to turn whole parallel classes; with that field gone the fine move is available and
the only obstruction left is the degenerate `2`-cycle. -/

/-! ## 5. The reversal equivalence and Gioan's theorem -/

/-- One **reversal move**: turn a directed cycle — finely (`reverseCycleOne`, one edge at
each step, the classical move) or coarsely (`reverseCycle`, the whole parallel class at each
step) — or turn a directed cut. Each in either direction; the relation is symmetric by
construction, which is all the `←` disjuncts are for.

Both cycle moves are included deliberately. The fine one is the move Gioan's theorem is
about, and it is the only one `gioan_reversalEquiv_of_linear_equiv` actually uses; the coarse
one is kept because it costs nothing — `isAcyclic_of_reversalStep` rules out *any* cycle
reversal at an acyclic orientation — and a larger step relation only makes an implication
*into* `ReversalEquiv` easier. Concretely, the proof of Gioan's theorem below reaches for
exactly two of the six disjuncts: the forward fine cycle reversal and the forward cut
reversal. -/

a directed cycle of the acyclic orientation we started from. A cocycle reversal preserves
acyclicity by

/-! ### The signed difference of two orientations

Everything below reads the pair `(O₁, O₂)` through one object: the antisymmetric integer
vector `diffFlow O₁ O₂` on ordered vertex pairs, which is the "signed edge set on which the
two orientations disagree" of Gioan's argument. Antisymmetry (`diffFlow_antisymm`) is the
`count_preserving` field, and `sum_diffFlow` says its divergence is the in-degree
difference. -/

/-! ### Step 1 of Gioan's theorem: equal in-degrees

This is where the *fine* cycle move earns its place. If `O₁` and `O₂` have the same in-degree
function then `diffFlow O₁ O₂` is a nonzero circulation, so following the pairs where `O₁`
beats `O₂` never gets stuck (`nonempty_relCycle_of_forward_step`). The resulting cycle is a
directed cycle of `O₁`, and reversing it *finely* moves exactly one unit of flow off each of
its steps: in-degrees are untouched (`indeg_reverseCycleOne`) and the disagreement strictly
shrinks. -/

This is the `σ = 0` case of Gioan's theorem, and it is the exact analogue of

/-! ### Step 2 of Gioan's theorem: the cut part

Write `d = indeg O₁ − indeg O₂`. Linear equivalence of the two orientation divisors says
`d = ∂∂ᵀψ` for an integer potential `ψ`, i.e. `d v = ∑ u (ψ u − ψ v) · num_edges v u`. The
whole of the cut half of Gioan's argument is then the following observation, which needs no
decomposition theory at all:

> Let `W` be the set where `ψ` attains its minimum. Then **every** edge between `W` and its
> complement points *into* `W` under `O₁`.

Indeed for `v ∈ W` every summand of `d v` is non-negative and the ones at `u ∉ W` are at
least `num_edges v u`, so `∑_{v ∈ W} d v ≥ e(W, Wᶜ)`. On the other hand the disagreement of
`O₁` and `O₂` inside `W` cancels by antisymmetry, so `∑_{v ∈ W} d v` is exactly
`(inflow into W under O₁) − (inflow into W under O₂)`, which is at most `e(W, Wᶜ)`. The two
bounds pin both quantities: the second inflow is `0` and the first is everything.

So `Wᶜ` is a directed cut of `O₁` and may be reversed. The reversal replaces `ψ` by
`ψ + χ_W`, which raises the minimum by one and leaves the maximum alone, so the *spread* of
the potential strictly drops and the induction is on that. -/

/-- **The minimum level set of the potential is a directed cut, already correctly oriented.**

/-- **Gioan's theorem, one direction:** orientations with linearly
equivalent orientation divisors are connected by cycle and cocycle reversals.

Reference: E. Gioan, *Enumerating degree sequences in digraphs and a cycle–cocycle reversing
system*, European J. Combin. 28 (2007) 1351–1366, where the cycle–cocycle reversing system
is introduced and its classes are identified with the classes of `D(𝒪)` modulo linear
equivalence. It is the lemma behind An–Baker–Kuperberg–Shokrieh, Theorem 1.2
(every degree-`g-1` class is `D(𝒪)` for some orientation).

**The proof, in two halves.** `linear_equiv` hands over a firing script `σ` with
`ordiv 𝒪₂ − ordiv 𝒪₁ = prin σ`, i.e. a potential `ψ = −σ` with
`indeg 𝒪₁ − indeg 𝒪₂ = ∂∂ᵀψ` pointwise. The induction is on the **spread**
`max ψ − min ψ`, a natural number because `G.V` is finite.

* **Spread `0`** — `ψ` constant, so the two in-degree functions agree, and
  `reversalEquiv_of_indeg_eq` finishes with fine cycle reversals alone: the signed
  disagreement `diffFlow` is then a circulation, following its positive support never gets
  stuck, and each directed cycle so found can be reversed one edge at a time, preserving
  in-degrees (`indeg_reverseCycleOne`) and strictly shrinking the disagreement.
* **Spread positive** — `isDirectedCut_compl_of_min` shows that the complement of the
  minimum level set `W` of `ψ` is *already* a directed cut of `𝒪₁`, so it may be reversed;
  `indeg_reverseCut_compl` identifies the effect on in-degrees as `prin χ_W`, which replaces
  `ψ` by `ψ + χ_W` and drops the spread by exactly one.

Notably no cycle/cut decomposition of `ℤ^E` is needed.  It is replaced by the observation in
`isDirectedCut_compl_of_min`, whose proof is two counting inequalities that squeeze each
other. `eq_of_indeg_eq_of_isAcyclic` above is the degenerate case `σ = 0` with `𝒪` acyclic.

Reference: E. Gioan, *Enumerating degree sequences in digraphs and a cycle–cocycle reversing
system*, European J. Combin. 28 (2007) 1351–1366. The proof here is not Gioan's.

**Model note (2026-08-20).** This used to carry a caveat saying the classical proof does not
transcribe, because a `CFOrientation` cycle reversal had to turn a whole parallel class. That
caveat is gone: `CFOrientation` is now an arbitrary edge-level orientation, and
`ReversalStep` includes the *fine* move `reverseCycleOne`, which turns a single edge at each
step and is exactly the move Gioan's system is built from. So on an arbitrary multigraph this
is now literally Gioan's theorem, hypothesis-free — in particular no simplicity and no
connectivity.

The converse implication is *not* stated, and is false as long as the coarse move is a legal
step: cocycle reversal preserves the class of `ordiv` (it changes it by the firing vector of
`W`) and so does the fine cycle reversal (`ordiv_reverseCycleOne`), but the coarse one does
not in general. -/
