# Rank-determining sets

A set `A` of vertices is *rank-determining* when the rank of every divisor can
be read off using only effective divisors supported on `A`:

```
rank G D ≥ r  ↔  ∀ E effective, deg E = r, supp E ⊆ A → winnable G (D - E)
```

The left-to-right implication is trivial and holds for every `A`
(`winnable_sub_of_rank_ge`); the content is the converse, which says that the
`|A|`-many tests already see everything the full quantifier over all effective
divisors of degree `r` would see.

## Main result and proof structure

On a subdivision of a **loopless** core, the core vertices are
rank-determining.  The finite-graph proof given here does not invoke Luo's
metric-graph theorem: it factors into a strong-separator argument at `r = 1`
and a purely arithmetic promotion from `r = 1` to all `r`.

Contents:

* `RankDeterminingSet` and its cheap general theory — the trivial direction,
  monotonicity in `A`, the fact that `Finset.univ` is rank-determining, and
  the specialization to `r = 1`, which reproduces
  `rank_ge_one_iff_winnable_sub_one_chip` from `Foundations/RankOne.lean`
  (`rank_ge_one_iff_winnable_sub_one_chip_of_univ`).
* `rankDeterminingSet_of_rank_ge_one` — **the `r = 1` case is the whole
  content**.  A set that decides rank one for every divisor is rank-determining
  at every `r`, by an induction that needs nothing about the graph.
* `Certificate.SubdivisionGraph.Spec.rank_ge_one_of_forall_mem_coreVertices` —
  the single geometric input, at `r = 1`, assembled from the strong-separator
  machinery.
* `Certificate.SubdivisionGraph.Spec.rankDeterminingSet_coreVertices` — the
  theorem itself, at general `r`, and its consumers
  `Spec.rank_ge_one_of_reaches_coreVertices` and
  `Spec.rank_ge_iff_core_criterion`.
* A two-sided rank criterion and its Riemann--Roch reduction
  (`winnable_iff_forall_add_supported_effective`,
  `rank_ge_iff_forall_sub_add_supported`): they take a rank-determining set as a
  hypothesis and derive a two-sided criterion, so that
  the `F`-quantifier costs no second appeal to the geometry.

Everything in this file is proved and depends only on
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

## How the theorem is proved

The proof has two halves.

**Half one, `r = 1`.**  The needed statement is that
a divisor reaching every core vertex has rank at least one, and that is the
strong-separator lemma of van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt (Lemma 2.6), formalized
here as `Certificate.StrongSeparator.rank_ge_one_of_strongSeparatorCertificate`
(`Subdivision/StrongSeparator.lean`).  Its hypothesis for the embedded core is
discharged by `Spec.coreVertices_strongSeparatorCertificate`
(`Subdivision/SubdivisionSeparator.lean`), which is exactly the "components of
the complement are slot interiors" step: after removing any enlargement of the
core, each remaining cell is a contiguous interval of positions inside a single
subdivided slot (`Spec.ComplementInterval`, `Spec.exists_complementInterval`),
and `Spec.expansionCell` checks the one-edge and path-cut conditions for it.
These two separator results supply the complete geometric input.

**Half two, `r = 1` implies every `r`: `rankDeterminingSet_of_rank_ge_one`.**
An induction on `r` in which each step applies the `r = 1` hypothesis at a
shifted divisor `D - E`.  No geometry, no induction on the degree of the test
divisor, and no second appeal to half one.  See the section header there.

Consequently **no metric graph appears anywhere**, and the discrete/metric
comparison of Hladký--Král--Norine (Theorem 1.3), which a genuine port of Luo
would have needed in order to descend to `spec.graph`, is not required either.

## The looplessness hypothesis is forced, not defensive

Luo's theorem (Thm. 1.6) is stated for a **loopless model** `(G, ℓ)` of a
metric graph `Γ`; the general criterion behind it (see the form quoted as
"Luo's Theorem" in Cools--Draisma--Payne--Robeva) asks that the closure in `Γ`
of every connected component of `Γ ∖ A` be contractible.

For a subdivision of a core with `A` = the core vertices, a component of
`Γ ∖ A` is the interior of a single edge slot, and its closure is that slot
together with its two endpoints:

* a slot joining **distinct** core vertices closes up to a segment — contractible,
  so the criterion is met;
* a **loop** slot at a core vertex `v` closes up to a circle — *not*
  contractible, and the criterion fails.

The same dichotomy is visible in the proof actually used here, without any
topology: a core vertex `v` carrying a **loop** slot of length `≥ 2` has *two*
edges into that slot's interior, so the interior violates the `oneEdge` field of
`StrongSeparator.ExpansionCell` and is not a strong-separator cell.  A slot
between distinct core vertices contributes one edge at each end, and is.

The failure is not an artifact of the proof: on a core carrying a loop slot, a
divisor can reach every core vertex and still fail to have rank one because the
obstruction lies in the interior of the loop chain.  Statements below therefore
carry looplessness explicitly.

Note that `Certificate.SubdivisionGraph.Spec` already demands
`core_loopless`, so the dangerous object cannot even be built through it.  That
is structural protection, but it is protection only as long as nobody
generalizes to a core type without the field: `ExplicitPotential.Core` itself
permits `tail e = head e`, and a loop slot of length `≥ 2` subdivides to a
perfectly legal loopless `CFGraph`.  This is why the looplessness hypothesis is
repeated as an explicit binder below rather than left implicit in the structure.

/-! ## From `r = 1` to every `r`

`RankDeterminingSet` quantifies over all `r`, but **the `r = 1` case is the
whole content**: `rankDeterminingSet_of_rank_ge_one` below promotes it to every
`r` with no further geometric input.  Only the `r = 1` case ever needs a fact
about the graph, so a consumer proving a set rank-determining has exactly one
obligation.

The promotion is an induction on `r`, and each step uses the `r = 1` hypothesis
at a *shifted divisor*:

* to see `rank D ≥ k + 1` it suffices to see `rank (D - w) ≥ k` for every vertex
  `w` (`rank_ge_add_one_of_forall_rank_sub_one_chip_ge`);
* to see `rank (D - w) ≥ k` the inductive hypothesis asks for
  `winnable (D - w - E)` for `E` effective of degree `k` supported on `A`;
* and that is `winnable (D - E - w)`, which follows from `rank (D - E) ≥ 1` —
  the `r = 1` hypothesis at the divisor `D - E`, whose own tests
  `winnable (D - E - v)` for `v ∈ A` are the degree-`(k+1)` tests of `D` at the
  supported divisors `E + v`.

No induction on the *degree* of the test divisor and no second appeal to the
geometry is involved. -/

/-! ## A two-sided criterion and its Riemann--Roch reduction

The relevant criterion is

```
rank D ≥ r  ↔  D - E + F winnable  for all effective E of degree r and
                all effective F of degree g - deg D + r - 1, both supported on A.
```

Although a rank-determining-set hypothesis appears relevant to both
quantifiers, the `F`-side is a Riemann--Roch consequence of the `E`-side.  The reduction is
`winnable_iff_forall_add_supported_effective` below, and it is short:

* `D` is winnable iff `rank (K - D) ≥ g - 1 - deg D`
  (`canonical_sub_rank_ge_iff_winnable_of_degree`);
* that rank inequality is tested on `A` by the *one* rank-determining-set
  hypothesis;
* each test `winnable (K - D - F)` is `winnable (K - (D + F))`, and
  `deg (D + F) = g - 1`, so it is `winnable (D + F)`
  (`degree_genus_sub_one_winnable_iff_complement_winnable`).

No induction on `deg F` is needed; the degree bookkeeping does it in one step.

It is *not* proved here by porting Luo's general metric-graph criterion.  The

  interiors"**.  `Spec.ComplementInterval` and `Spec.exists_complementInterval`
  show that after removing any enlargement `R ⊇ core vertices`, every remaining
  cell is a contiguous interval `(left, right)` of positions inside a *single*
  subdivided slot, with `left` and `right` in `R`; `Spec.expansionCell` packages
  such an interval as a `StrongSeparator.ExpansionCell`, verifying the two
  properties that fail for a loop slot — one edge per boundary vertex into the
  cell, and the path-cut condition.  Culminates in
  `Spec.coreVertices_strongSeparatorCertificate`.
* `StrongSeparator.lean` — **"the one-path lemma implies the theorem"**.
  `StrongSeparator.rank_ge_one_of_strongSeparatorCertificate` is the discrete
  form of van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt, Lemma 2.6: enlarge the core to the set
  `R` of *all* vertices reached by `D`, and if `R ≠ univ` a complementary cell
  plus one `q`-reduction produces a vertex outside `R` that `D` reaches after
  all — a contradiction.

**Where looplessness enters.**  `Spec` carries `core_loopless` as a field, and
it is used twice in the chain above: `stepLeft_ne_stepRight` needs it to build
`spec.graph` at all when a slot has length one, and — the substantive use — the
`oneEdge` field of the expansion cell needs it, because a core vertex `v`
carrying a loop slot of length `≥ 2` has **two** edges into that slot's
interior, so the interior is not a strong-separator cell. -/

/-- **A finite-graph special case of Luo's rank-determining set theorem.**
On the subdivision of a finite loopless core, the core vertices are
rank-determining: for every divisor `D` and every `r`, `rank D ≥ r` already
follows from winnability of `D - E` for the effective divisors `E` of degree `r`
supported at core vertices.

The general statement is Ye Luo, *Rank-determining sets of metric graphs*,
J. Combin. Theory Ser. A **118** (2011), 1775--1793, Theorem 1.6 ("for a
loopless model `(G, ℓ)` of a metric graph `Γ`, the set `V(G) ⊆ Γ` is
rank-determining").  **Luo is not used, and no metric graph appears.**  In the
special case at hand — a subdivision of a loopless core, tested at its own core
vertices — the theorem factors into two elementary halves:

* the `r = 1` case, `Spec.rank_ge_one_of_forall_mem_coreVertices`, which is the
  strong-separator argument on the slot-interval decomposition of the
  complement (see that docstring for the full attribution);
* the promotion from `r = 1` to all `r`,
  `rankDeterminingSet_of_rank_ge_one`, which is pure divisor bookkeeping and
  uses nothing about the graph.

Consequently no discrete/metric comparison (Hladký--Král--Norine, Theorem 1.3)
is needed either: the whole argument stays on the finite graph `spec.graph`.

**Looplessness is a hypothesis of the theorem, not a convenience.**
`hLoopless` restates the field `spec.core_loopless`; it is an explicit binder
so that no consumer can invoke this result without meeting it, and so that a
future restatement over a core type that does not build looplessness in
(`ExplicitPotential.Core` does not) keeps it.  With a loop slot at a core vertex
`v`, that vertex has two edges into the slot's interior, the interior is not a
strong-separator cell, the closure of the corresponding component of
`Γ ∖ (core vertices)` is a circle rather than a segment, and the conclusion is
false: a divisor may reach every core vertex of a loop-carrying core and still
have rank zero, with the obstruction living in the loop chain's interior.

`hConnected` is needed by the `q`-reduced-representative step inside the
strong-separator lemma and by the Riemann--Roch argument. -/
