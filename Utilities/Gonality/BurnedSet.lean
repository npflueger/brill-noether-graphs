# The burned set, without Dhar's algorithm

Dhar's burning algorithm takes `(G, D, q)` and returns the maximal valid set
`A ⊆ V(G) \ {q}`; the *burned* vertices are the complement of `A`.  Every use of
the algorithm in the divisorial-gonality literature is a use of exactly two of
its properties — maximality of `A`, and the rule "a vertex with fewer chips than
burned incident edges burns" — and both are available without running anything.

The dependency's `legal_set_union` says legal sets are closed under union,
so the maximal legal subset of `V \ {q}` is a `Finset.sup` over a powerset:

* `maximalLegal G D q` — the join of every legal `U ⊆ univ.erase q`;
* `burned G D q := (maximalLegal G D q)ᶜ` — the burned set.

The API below is the whole of Dhar that the tricycle campaign
(the accompanying analysis §4.1) ever uses:

* `legalSet_maximalLegal`, `subset_maximalLegal_of_legal` — maximality;
* `mem_burned_self`, `mem_burned_of_lt`, `mem_burned_of_subset_lt`,
  `mem_burned_of_mem_burned_adj` — the burning rule;
* `sum_burned_le_of_not_mem_burned` — the *converse* rule, which is what turns
  "`v` is unburned" into a chip count;
* `qReduced_iff_maximalLegal_eq_empty` — the fire consumes everything exactly
  when `D` is `q`-reduced;
* `mem_maximalLegal_of_qReduced` — **Lemma 3.5(a)** of van Dobben de
  Bruyn–Smit–van der Wegen, in full generality: a `q`-reduced divisor's own
  `q` is never burned by a fire started anywhere else.

No algorithm, no termination proof, no fuel.  `maximalLegal` is `noncomputable`
and is only ever used propositionally; never `decide` it (blueprint risk R2).

/-! ## Opacity

`maximalLegal` is a `Finset.sup` over the powerset of `univ.erase q`.  Left
reducible, any `isDefEq` check between two `x ∈ burned G D q` types whose
vertices are *closed* terms (a `Fin` numeral, a `Sum.inl`, a `Fin.mk`) falls
through congruence and starts evaluating `Finset.univ`, `List.erase` and
`instDecidableEqSum.decEq` on the subdivision vertex type. Since the
whole point of the design is that `maximalLegal` is used *propositionally only*
sealing both definitions costs nothing and makes every such
comparison structural.  Everything above this line is stated and proved before
the seal; nothing below may unfold either definition. -/
