# A linear non-existence certificate for positive rank

Every gonality *upper* bound in this repository is witnessed by a divisor and a
firing script.  This module supplies the missing other half: a small, checkable
witness that a given divisor **does not** have positive rank.

The obstacle is that `q_reduced` (in the chip-firing dependency) quantifies over
*all* subsets of `V \ {q}`, so deciding it directly costs `2^{n-1}`.  A
**burning order** replaces that quantifier by an `n`-step linear check:

> a list `π = (q = u₀, u₁, …)` containing every vertex, in which every entry
> after the first satisfies `D(uⱼ) < Σ_{i<j} num_edges G uⱼ uᵢ`.

Soundness (`qReduced_of_burningOrder`): given a nonempty `S ⊆ V \ {q}`, the
*least* index `j` with `uⱼ ∈ S` has all its predecessors outside `S`, so the
displayed inequality already exhibits a vertex of `S` that cannot afford to
fire.  The order is exactly a run of Dhar's burning algorithm recorded as data,
but nothing about the algorithm — termination, maximality, or otherwise — is
needed to check it.

The full certificate refuting `rank G D ≥ 1` is the triple `(v, x, π)`:

* a vertex `v`;
* a firing script `x` carrying `D` to `D' := D + prin G x`;
* a burning order `π` for `(D', v)`;

together with `D' ≥ 0 off v` and `D' v ≤ 0`
(`not_rank_ge_one_of_burningOrder`).  Every component is `decide`-shaped:
`BurningOrder` quantifies over `Fin π.length` and `G.V`, both finite.

/-- **A burning order** for `(D, v)`: a list of vertices whose head is `v`,
containing every vertex, in which every entry after the first has strictly fewer
chips than it has edges to its predecessors.

Repetitions are harmless; only the *first* occurrence of each vertex matters to
the soundness proof. -/

/-! ## The non-existence certificate -/

/-- **The certificate refuting positive rank.**  A vertex `v`, a script `x`, and
a burning order for `D + prin G x` at `v` whose divisor is effective off `v` and
carries no chip at `v`.

The proof is two lines of divisor bookkeeping on top of
`qReduced_of_burningOrder`: linear equivalence preserves rank, and a `q`-reduced
divisor of positive rank carries a chip at `q`
(`one_le_apply_of_q_reduced_of_rank_geq_one`). -/
