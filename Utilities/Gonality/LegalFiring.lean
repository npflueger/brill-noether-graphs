# Legal set firings and the nested reduction chain

This module supplies the divisor-theoretic input of the van Dobben de
Bruyn--Gijswijt proof that `treewidth ≤ gonality`: their Lemma 1.3, which says
that an effective divisor can be driven to its `q`-reduced form through a
**nested** chain of legal set firings, every intermediate divisor effective.

The dependency (`chip-firing-with-lean`) supplies the legal-set vocabulary,
set-firing formulas, script primitives, and reduced-divisor chip test. What it
does not yet supply is the truncation lemma or nestedness of the firing sets,
which is what the extremal argument in
`TreewidthGonality/Gonality/BrambleGonality.lean` needs.

## Conventions (multiplicity!)

`outdeg_S G U v = ∑_{u ∉ U} num_edges G v u` counts **with edge multiplicity**,
matching both `set_firing` and the dependency's `q_reduced`. Firing every
vertex of `U` exactly once satisfies

* `set_firing G D U v = D v - outdeg_S G U v` for `v ∈ U`;
* `set_firing G D U v = D v + outdeg_S G Uᶜ v` for `v ∉ U`

— chips only ever *leave* the fired set and only ever *arrive* outside it.

A set `U` is **legal** for `D` when firing it keeps `D` effective, i.e.
`D u ≥ outdeg_S G U u` for all `u ∈ U`.

/-! ## Firing scripts and truncation

The nested chain below is obtained as the **level-set decomposition** of the
firing script that carries `D` to its `q`-reduced representative, so this section
records the one remaining piece of script calculus it needs. -/

/-- Firing everything once changes nothing, so **firing `Uᶜ` undoes firing `U`**.
This is what turns the step `Dⱼ₋₁ → Dⱼ` around in the main theorem: `Dⱼ₋₁` is
obtained from `Dⱼ` by firing the complement of `U j`. -/

/-- **The truncation lemma.**  If `D` and `D + prin G x` are both effective then so
is every intermediate divisor obtained by truncating the script from below:
`D + prin G (x - c)⁺` is effective for every `c`.

This is the whole content of the nested chain: the level sets of `x` fire in
increasing order and every partial sum is such a truncation. -/

/-! ## The nested chain (van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt, Lemma 1.3) -/

/-- **The nested legal chain.**  From an effective divisor `D` and a vertex `q`
there is a finite chain of legal firings, with the fired sets *nested* and
avoiding `q`, whose end result is `q`-reduced.

Proved (2026-08-25); this is Lemma 1.3 of van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt
(arXiv:1407.7055), and only existence is claimed — the paper never uses
uniqueness of the chain.

**The route actually taken is the paper's level-set decomposition, not the
"maximal legal set" route this docstring used to recommend.**  That route is a
dead end: a set `U` legal for `D` is *not* in general legal for
`set_firing G D U` (that would need `D u ≥ 2 · outdeg_S G U u`), so maximality at consecutive steps
does not force nestedness.  What works instead:

* take `D'`, the `q`-reduced representative of `D` (`exists_q_reduced_representative`),
  effective because `D` is (`effective_of_winnable_and_q_reduced`);
* write `D' = D + prin G x` and normalize the script by `x q = 0`
  (`prin_sub_const`);
* `x ≥ 0`: the bottom level set `W = {v | x v = min x}` is legal for `D'` — it is
  the first firing of the *reverse* chain, so `effective_add_prin_truncate`
  applies — and a `q`-reduced divisor admits no nonempty legal subset of
  `univ.erase q`, forcing `q ∈ W`, i.e. `min x = x q = 0`;
* the chain is the level-set family `U i = {v | K - i ≤ x v}` with `K = max x`,
  fired in *increasing* order `i = 0, …, K-1`.  Its partial sums are exactly the
  truncations `(x - (K - t))⁺`, so `effective_add_prin_truncate` makes every
  intermediate divisor effective, which is the same thing as legality of each
  step; and the last truncation is `x` itself, so the chain ends at `D'`.

The only real content is `effective_add_prin_truncate`, four lines of case
analysis on `x v ≤ c`. -/
