# Orientation divisors and rank one

`ordiv G O = indeg_O - 1` has degree `g - 1`, so the orientation model is a
natural setting for the critical pencil `(1, g-1)`.

`legal_of_ordiv_iff` characterizes the legal firing sets of an orientation
divisor. The main sufficient criterion,
`rank_ge_one_of_inHeavyReachable`, says that `ordiv G O` has rank at least one
when its class contains, for each vertex `q`, a source-free orientation with
`2 ≤ indeg q`. By `gioan_reversalEquiv_of_linear_equiv`, this hypothesis can
also be expressed as reachability in the cycle--cocycle reversal system.

/-- **In-heavy reachability certifies rank one.**  If the divisor class of `ordiv G O`
contains, for every vertex `q`, an orientation divisor that is source-free and in-heavy at
`q`, then `rank G (ordiv G O) ≥ 1`.

By `gioan_reversalEquiv_of_linear_equiv` the hypothesis is equivalent to reachability of
such an orientation from `O` in the cycle–cocycle reversal system, which is the form the
distillation note states.  The converse fails — see the module docstring. -/

/-- **Legality for an orientation divisor is intrinsic to the induced subdigraph.**

`u ∈ U` can pay its whole boundary out of `ordiv G O` exactly when it receives strictly
more arcs from inside `U` than it sends outside `U`.  The arcs entering `u` *from outside*
`U` cancel: they are counted once by `indeg` and once by `outdeg_S`.

The characterization is expressed entirely in terms of arc counts inside and
across the boundary of `U`. -/

/-- **The counting corollary.**  A set that Dhar's fire fails to burn must induce a
subdigraph with at least `|U| + (arcs leaving U)` internal arcs.

For a strongly connected `O` every proper nonempty `U` has `1 ≤ arcsOut O U`, so every
legal set induces a subgraph with strictly more edges than vertices — first Betti number at
least two once the boundary is counted.  On sparse graphs (cubic cores, say) such sets are
rare, `ordiv G O` is already `q`-reduced at the in-degree-one vertices, and the rank is
zero.  That is the whole failure. -/
