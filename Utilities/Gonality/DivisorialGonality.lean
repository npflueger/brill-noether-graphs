# Divisorial gonality as a natural number

The dependency already defines `gonality_leq G k` and a noncomputable
`gonality h_conn : ℤ` (`ChipFiringWithLean/RiemannRoch.lean`).  The
treewidth/gonality chain wants to compare gonality with `treewidth`, which is a
`ℕ`, so this module packages the same invariant as an `sInf` over `ℕ` and proves
the bridges in both directions.

* `gonalitySet G : Set ℕ` — degrees of **effective** divisors of rank at least
  one.  Adding effectivity does not change the set of achievable degrees (a
  divisor of rank `≥ 1` is winnable, and both degree and rank are linear
  equivalence invariants), but it is the form the van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt
  argument consumes.
* `divisorialGonality G := sInf (gonalitySet G)`.  Nonemptiness of `gonalitySet`
  for connected `G` (`gonalitySet_nonempty`, via the dependency's
  `gonality_leq_genus_add_one`) is what makes the `sInf` meaningful rather than
  the `sInf ∅ = 0` default; every statement that needs it takes
  `graph_connected G`.
* Bridges: `BNExists_one_divisorialGonality`,
  `divisorialGonality_le_of_BNExists`, and
  `gonality_eq_divisorialGonality` (the dependency's `ℤ`-valued `gonality` is
  the coercion of this one).
