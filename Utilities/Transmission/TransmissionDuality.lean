# Canonical duality for transmission witnesses

Riemann--Roch exchanges the two marks and inverts the ASP permutation.  With
the row convention used by `SatisfiesTransmission`, the literal canonical
complement is off by one in each marked coordinate.  The normalized complement
is therefore

`K - D + u + v`.

It has the degree prescribed by `τ⁻¹`, and its rows are exactly those required
for `τ⁻¹` at the swapped marks.
