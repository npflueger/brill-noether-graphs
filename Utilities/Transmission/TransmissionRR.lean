# Riemann--Roch duality for transmission rows

For a transmission witness, every marked twist has known degree.  Riemann--Roch
therefore converts its rank inequality into an equivalent lower bound for the
canonical complement.  This file packages that conversion without yet using
any ASP-specific simplification of the complementary slipface expression.
