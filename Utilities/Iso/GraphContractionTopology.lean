# Topological graph-contraction certificates

`GraphContractionCertificate.Valid` records the quotient multiplicities.  A
topological contraction additionally has connected vertex fibres.  This file
expresses that condition by the same finite-cut criterion as
`graph_connected`, so it admits an exact Boolean replay checker.

The fibre condition is deliberately separate from `Valid`: quotient
multiplicities alone do not prevent a certificate from identifying two
disconnected pieces of the source graph.
