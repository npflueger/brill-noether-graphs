# Topology and gonality of the fossil

The short library name `fossil` means the degree-one Abel--Jacobi image, or
2-edge-connectivization, of a connected graph.  This file packages the facts
needed by public applications: the fossil remains connected, has the same
cyclomatic genus and divisorial gonality, and has no one-edge cuts or leaves.

/-- The fossil has the same cyclomatic genus as a connected graph.

The proof avoids a separate edge-count analysis of the bridge forest.  Take a
divisor in the nonspecial range for both graphs.  Fossil pushforward preserves
its degree and rank, while Riemann--Roch says that this rank is `degree - genus`
on each side, forcing the genera to agree. -/
