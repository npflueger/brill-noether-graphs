# The endpoint pencil on a two-vertex subdivision core (light half)

Every slot of a loopless two-vertex core joins the same two core vertices.
The divisor consisting of one chip at each endpoint has rank at least one for
arbitrary positive integral slot lengths: a chip removed in the interior of a
slot is recovered by the exact segment-reflection potential on that slot.

This packages the uniform hyperelliptic argument for banana graphs.  It
depends only on the segment-reflection and rank-one layers.
