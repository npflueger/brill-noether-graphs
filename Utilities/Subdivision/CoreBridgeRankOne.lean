# Rank one across a checked genus-two/genus-two core bridge

A separating core slot remains a separating unit edge in every positive
subdivision.  When its two induced factors have genus two, elementary
Brill--Noether existence supplies degree-two pencils on the factors and the
bridge gluing theorem removes one chip.  The result is a degree-three pencil
on the original subdivision, uniformly in all positive slot lengths.

This is the structural shortcut used by the first Draisma--Vargas genus-four
type.  It is independent of that application and of any finite cone cover.
