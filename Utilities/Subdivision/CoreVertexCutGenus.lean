# Genus of factors cut from a subdivided core

The finite core-cut checker already lifts articulation data uniformly over
all positive integral edge lengths.  This file computes the genera of the
two induced factors from the same finite data.  Counts are made on ordered
core **slots**, not endpoint pairs, so parallel occurrences remain distinct.

Every slot wholly contained in one core side contributes its entire
subdivided path to that factor.  Its `L` unit edges and `L - 1` new vertices
cancel in Euler characteristic, leaving one edge-slot contribution.  Hence
the answer is independent of every subdivision length.
