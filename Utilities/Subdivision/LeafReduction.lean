# One-step reduction across a degree-one vertex

`LeafPruning` identifies a graph with a degree-one vertex, up to a
Laplacian-preserving relabeling, with an explicit `LeafExtension.addLeaf` of
the graph obtained by deleting that vertex.  This file records the invariant
facts needed to use that construction recursively:

* deleting the leaf preserves genus;
* deleting the leaf preserves connectivity when the original graph is
  connected; and
* a recursive rank-one existence result on the smaller connected graph lifts
  to the original graph.

The last theorem is deliberately a one-step interface.  A global iteration
still needs a well-founded wrapper (for example, recursion on the number of
vertices) and a choice of a degree-one vertex at every nonterminal step.
