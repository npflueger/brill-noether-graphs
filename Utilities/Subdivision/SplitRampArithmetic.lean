# Two canonical ramps meeting at an interior chip

`SubdivisionArithmetic.potential` realizes a rise over a slot by the convex
two-slope interpolation, whose unit slopes are nondecreasing.  That convexity
is exactly what makes `DegSpec.interpolatedScript`'s interior Laplacian
nonnegative -- and exactly what makes a single ramp useless for a divisor whose
chip sits *inside* a slot: a convex script never draws on that chip, so the row
would have to succeed with the remaining core-supported chips alone.

Atanasov--Ranganathan's sixth and seventh genus-five families (rows `05` and
`08` of the atlas) are of that kind: no core-supported degree-four divisor
covers either row, and the figures place two of the four chips at interior
points whose offset is a length.

This file supplies the replacement slot value.  `splitPotential L t first
second` is the canonical ramp of rise `first` over the first `t` unit steps,
followed by the canonical ramp of rise `second` over the remaining `L - t`.
It is convex on each side of `t`, and it may be concave exactly at `t`, where
the divisor's chip pays for the deficit.  `splitStep_kink_ge_neg_one` bounds
that deficit by one chip, under a hypothesis every intended configuration has
anyway: neither ramp is steeper than one unit per step, and one of the two is
flat -- the chip is placed exactly where a flat stretch meets a full ramp.

Everything here is arithmetic on `ℕ` and `ℤ`.  The layer that turns it into a
firing script is generic already -- `DegSpec.slotValueScript`,
`DegSpec.SlotValueCompatible` and `DegSpec.IsStepSlope` in
`Utilities/Subdivision/DegenerateSlopeScript.lean` are stated for an
arbitrary slot-value function, `interpolatedScript` being merely the instance
whose value is one ramp.
