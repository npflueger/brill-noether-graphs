# Rank-one existence from reaching the core of a subdivision

The embedded core vertices are a strong separator in every positive
subdivision.  Consequently, on a connected subdivision, it is enough for a
divisor to reach every core vertex in order to have rank at least one.  This
is the common final step shared by explicit-potential, loop-split, and local
configuration certificates.
