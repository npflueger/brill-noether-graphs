# Burning along a subdivided slot

The burned-set layer of `Utilities/Gonality/BurnedSet.lean` is stated for an
arbitrary `CFGraph`.  On a subdivision the fire propagates along slots, and the
moves used over and over by van Dobben de Bruyn–Smit–van der Wegen's §3 are:

* **chip-free stretches burn** (`mem_burned_slotVertex_of_chipFree_up` and its
  downward twin) — from a burned position the fire runs to the end of a
  chip-free stretch of the slot;
* **a burned/unburned split costs a chip** (`exists_chip_up`, `exists_chip_down`)
  — the first unburned vertex past the fire front is adjacent to a burned one,
  so it can afford that edge, so it carries a chip;
* **cycle blocking** (`two_le_chips_of_cycle`) — two distinct slots with the
  same endpoints form a cycle; if one endpoint burns and the other does not, the
  cycle carries at least two chips.

The cycle lemma is stated via **two internally disjoint arcs** rather than via
distinct interior vertices, which is what makes it cover the *banana* case (both
slots of length one, so the cycle has only two vertices).  There the two
witnesses coincide at the unburned endpoint, whose two edges to the burned
endpoint are parallel, and the edge *multiplicity* supplies the second chip
(`two_le_num_edges_of_parallel_unit`).  Getting this case right is what makes
the minimal tricycle `T_m` itself tractable, not merely its simple refinements.

## Numerical slot positions

`spec.slotVertex e k` is the vertex at position `k` along slot `e`, clamped to
the slot so that no proof obligation rides along.  Position `0` is the core
tail, position `spec.length e` the core head, and the positions strictly
between are the slot interior.  Statements carry explicit
`k ≤ spec.length e` hypotheses wherever clamping would otherwise silently
change the meaning.
