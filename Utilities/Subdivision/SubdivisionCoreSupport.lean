# Core-supported rank-one divisors on subdivisions

The embedded core vertices of a positive subdivision are a strong separator.
Thus a particularly small uniform rank-one witness is available whenever one
can put a positive number of chips at every core vertex.  This module records
that observation without referring to a genus, a trivalence hypothesis, or a
certificate search.

The first theorem is deliberately graph-theoretic: an effective divisor with
at least one chip at every member of a certified strong separator has rank at
least one.  The subdivision theorems specialize it to the transparent divisor
which is zero on every edge-interior vertex.
