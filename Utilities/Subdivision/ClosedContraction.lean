# A closed-orthant row proof implies every contraction of its row

the corresponding closed-row proof module moves a `(domain closed)` row proof down to the
*same* core's open-orthant obligation, by observing that a strictly positive
length vector has empty vanishing set.  This file makes the other, larger
move: the closed orthant of a core `C` also contains, as a **face**, the whole
closed orthant of every equal-genus contraction `C / F`.

Concretely, let `F` be a slot set of `C` which is a forest and whose
contraction leaves no loop, and let `C'` be the contracted core.  Send a
length vector `ℓ'` of `C'` to the length vector of `C` that is `ℓ'` on the
surviving slots and `0` on `F`.  Its vanishing set is exactly `F`, so a closed
row proof of `C` applies there, and
`Utilities.Certificate.DegenerateSpec.DegSpec.Contraction.laplacianEquiv` identifies the resulting
degenerate graph with the honest subdivision of `C'`.

So one closed-orthant row proof discharges the open-orthant obligation of its
core *and of every core below it in the contraction order*.

## What the data has to supply, and why orientation is a real constraint

`DegenerateSpec.Contraction` matches slots **with their orientation**: it asks
for `vtx (C'.tail e') = rep (C.tail (slot e'))`, not for the unordered pair.
Slot reversal is deliberately not part of that structure — it is supplied
separately by `SubdivisionGraph.Spec.Relabeling`.  `ContractionData` below
inherits that restriction, so it witnesses only orientation-exact
contractions.  A contraction that needs a slot flipped has to be composed with
a `Relabeling`; that composition is not built here.

## Where this does *not* reach

Contracting a slot of a **split loop** (a bivalent marker `w` carrying two
parallel slots to its base `v`) is never admissible: contracting one of the
pair identifies `v` with `w`, so the other becomes a loop and `IsLoopy` holds;
contracting both is not a forest.  The number of split loops is therefore
constant along every face reachable this way, and a loop-carrying row is never
a face of a loopless one.  See the corresponding closed-row proof module.
