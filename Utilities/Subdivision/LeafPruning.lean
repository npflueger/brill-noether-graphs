# Pruning a degree-one vertex

This is the structural inverse to `LeafExtension.addLeaf`.  From a vertex of
valence exactly one we construct the graph on the remaining subtype, identify
the unique neighbor, and exhibit the original graph as a `LaplacianEquiv` of
the corresponding explicit leaf extension.  The rank-one lifting theorem is
then an immediate composition of the two small certificate interfaces.
