# A union-find two-edge-connectivity check for ordered cores

`ExplicitPotential.Core.twoEdgeConnectedCheck`
(`Utilities/Subdivision/SubdivisionTwoEdgeCut.lean:190`) decides
`ExplicitPotential.Core.TwoEdgeConnected` by enumerating **all `2ⁿ` vertex
subsets** and counting the slots that cross each one.  That is the definition
read literally, and it is exact, but it makes every kernel-checked
two-edge-connectivity fact cost exponentially in the number of core vertices.
It is the same shape `Utilities/Subdivision/ConnectedCheckFast.lean` was
written to replace for plain connectedness, and it was left behind there.

This file gives the same information for the price of `p + 1` union--find
folds.  The reading is the standard one: a core is two-edge connected exactly
when it is connected **and** deleting any single slot leaves it connected.
Deleting a slot needs no new datum, because `compFold core F` already takes an
arbitrary slot set: `compFold core (Finset.univ.erase e)` *is* the component
map of the core with slot `e` removed.

## Why the connectivity conjunct is not redundant

Dropping `connectedCheckFast` makes the checker wrong at `p = 0`: the
two-vertex edgeless core `Core 2 0` has `Finset.univ.erase e` vacuously
constant (there is no `e`), so the fold condition holds, while the core is not
even connected.  For `p ≥ 1` the fold condition alone does imply connectedness,
but the conjunction is the honest statement and costs one extra fold.

## Measured

At `n = 8`, `p = 12` (the genus-five atlas), on the sixteen
Atanasov--Ranganathan rows, `by decide +kernel`, measured back-to-back in one
batch and reproduced:

| check | sixteen cores |
|---|---|
| `twoEdgeConnectedCheck` (`2⁸ = 256` subsets × a `Fin 12` filter each) | **12.6 s** |
| `twoEdgeConnectedCheckFast` (`13` folds of `8²` comparisons) | **1.95 s** |

The saving grows with `n`: the old checker doubles per core vertex, the new one
grows linearly in `n · p`.

## What is proved

`twoEdgeConnectedCheckFast_eq_true_iff` is a genuine `iff`, so this is a
drop-in replacement for `twoEdgeConnectedCheck_eq_true_iff` and not merely a
sufficient condition.  The forward direction is the one every call site uses;
the converse is here so that a reader does not have to wonder whether the cheap
check is also complete.  Neither checker is removed: `twoEdgeConnectedCheck`
remains the literal reading of the definition and stays available as an
independent cross-check.
