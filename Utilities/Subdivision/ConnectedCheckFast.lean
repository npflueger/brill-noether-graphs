# A union-find connectivity check for ordered cores

`ExplicitPotential.Core.connectedCheck`
(`Utilities/Subdivision/SubdivisionConnectivity.lean`) decides
`ExplicitPotential.Core.Connected` by enumerating **all `2ⁿ` vertex subsets**
and looking for a crossing slot in each.  That is the definition read
literally, and it is exact, but it makes every kernel-checked connectivity fact
cost exponentially in the number of core vertices.

This file gives the same information for the price of a union--find fold.  The
partition machinery is already present: `compFold core F` is the canonical
representative map obtained by contracting the slots of `F`, and
`compFold_iff` says `compFold`-equality *is* reachability
(`Utilities/Subdivision/ContractionForestCensusGeneral.lean`).  Taking
`F = Finset.univ`, a core is connected exactly when that map is constant.

## Measured

At `n = 8`, `p = 12` (the genus-five atlas), on the sixteen
Atanasov--Ranganathan rows, `by decide +kernel`:

| check | per core |
|---|---|
| `connectedCheck` (`2⁸ = 256` subsets × `8² + 12` tests) | **0.54 s** |
| `connectedCheckFast` (one fold, `8²` comparisons) | **0.01 s** |

a factor of about fifty, measured back-to-back in one batch and reproduced.
The genus-five library performed twenty-nine such checks, so this is
about fifteen seconds of kernel time, ten of it on the critical path
(`GenusFiveCoreAtlas` → `GenusFiveCubicAtlas`).  The saving grows with `n`:
genus six classifies sixty-six cores at `n = 10`, where the old checker
enumerates `1024` subsets.

## What is proved

`connectedCheckFast_eq_true_iff` is a genuine `iff`, so this is a drop-in
replacement for `connectedCheck_eq_true_iff` and not merely a sufficient
condition.  The forward direction is the one every call site uses; the
converse is here so that a reader does not have to wonder whether the cheap
check is also complete.  Neither checker is removed: `connectedCheck` remains
the literal reading of the definition and stays available as an independent
cross-check.
