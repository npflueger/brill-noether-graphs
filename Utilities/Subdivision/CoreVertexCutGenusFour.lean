# Checked genus-four rank-one core cuts

A proof-free core articulation is sufficient for the genus-four critical
pencil when its factor genera are `(2,2)`, or `(3,1)` with the genus-one
side two-regular.  The checker and its soundness theorem are public and apply
uniformly to every positive subdivision.
