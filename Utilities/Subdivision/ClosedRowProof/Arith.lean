# The row-proof arithmetic layer, deep-embedded

This is step A of the proof-data source: affine forms, contexts, and the
entailment checker of the format spec §4.1 / §13.4, as `Bool` functions over
`List ℤ`, proved sound once.

## Representation discipline

Everything generated is `List ℤ` addressed with `List.getD`.  No `![…]`, no
`Fin`-indexed functions, no `Matrix.cons`.  This is not a style preference:
the accompanying analysis §5 measured 198 s of kernel
type-checking for one `rfl` through `![…]` at a `Fin` numeral against 15 ms
for the same goal by `decide`, and the accompanying analysis records 189,527
unfoldings of `instDecidableEqSum.decEq` from the same family of mistake.

## The one design decision worth recording

A form `c + Σ aᵢ xᵢ` is stored as the single list `c :: a`, and evaluated as
`dot g (1 :: x)` — the constant is just the coefficient of a leading `1`
coordinate.  Evaluation is then *literally* a dot product, so it is additive
and homogeneous in the form by two three-line inductions, and every soundness
step downstream is linear algebra rather than case analysis on the head.

Out-of-range certificate indices need no bounds check.  `List.getD` returns
`[]` there, `eval [] x = 0`, and a zero row is harmless on both sides: with a
nonnegative multiplier it contributes `0 ≥ 0` to the inequality part, and any
multiplier contributes `0` to the equality part.  So the checker is
fail-closed on malformed indices without spending a comparison on them.

A certificate for `Γ ⊢ g ≥ 0` is `(k; λ; μ; c)` with `k ≥ 1`, `λ` sparse
nonnegative weights into `Γ.ge`, `μ` sparse weights into `Γ.eq`, `c ≥ 0`, and

    k · g  =  Σ λᵢ Γ.geᵢ  +  Σ μⱼ Γ.eqⱼ  +  c

as an identity of forms.  Nothing searches for `λ`; the generator supplies it.
