# Marked leaf checkers: domination, multiplicity residuals, legged and pointed leaves

The generic row-proof checker in this directory validates a leaf against the
five closed-face rows `W1`–`W5` plus the degree row `W7`.  A leaf that also
carries a **mark** — a distinguished core vertex at which the divisor must
dominate, or at which a residual must be read with multiplicity greater than
one — needs two more executable rows, and a leaf carrying **two** marks (a
"legged" leaf, in the vocabulary of the once- and twice-marked programmes)
needs one more table per mark.

Those rows were written privately, one copy per marked programme, on top of a
private duplicate of this checker.  They are generic: nothing below mentions a
genus, a row, or a marked-graph existence statement.  They belong here, beside
the checker they extend, so that the checker's namespace stays self-contained
in its own directory.

## What is here, and what deliberately is not

* the four **leaf checkers**, assembled from the two doubled-anchor rows in
  `Utilities/Subdivision/DoubledAnchorChecks.lean`:
  `Witness.leggedLeafChecks`, `Witness.pointedLeafChecks`,
  `RichWitness.pointedLeafChecks`, `RichWitness.richLeggedLeafChecks`;
* `RichWitness.richDivisor_rank_ge_one`, the strong-separator half of
  `richLeaf_sound` stated for the divisor rather than for `BNExists`, because a
  legged leaf needs the divisor itself.

**Not here, by design:** the soundness theorems that consume these rows —
`effective_degenerateDivisor_sub_smul_one_chip`,
`class_mult_balance_nonnegative`,
`winnable_sub_smul_one_chip_degenerateCoreVertex` and the marked-completion
bridges.  They are heavier, they are consumed only by the marked programmes,
and promoting them would buy nothing here.  They stay in
`MarkedGraphs/Certificate/DegenerateDoubledAnchor.lean`, which imports this
file.

## Why the checkers and not just the definitions

`Witness` and `RichWitness` are the structures declared in this directory.
Dot notation resolves `w.leggedLeafChecks` in the namespace of `w`'s type, so a
checker written elsewhere is invisible to `w.leggedLeafChecks` however the
file is imported.  Keeping these four here is what lets the marked programmes
consume the row-proof checker without maintaining a second copy of it.

/-- **The legged rich leaf checker.**  `richLeafChecks` plus one W5 table per

There is deliberately no W7 domination row: the first mark's obligation is
supplied as winnability by its own W5 table.  Compare
`Witness.leggedLeafChecks`, which does carry a domination row because the
compact leaf's divisor is available pointwise. -/
