# `leaf_sound`: the row-proof leaf, lowered to Lean

This is step B of the proof-data source.  A `LEAF` node of a row proof carries a
local witness (spec §4.3); this file turns an accepted witness into
`BNExists … 1 d` on the degenerate subdivision determined by *any* length
vector whose vanishing set is a non-loopy forest.

## Representation discipline

Every generated form is a `List ℤ` addressed with `List.getD`, as in
the corresponding closed-row proof module.  `§1` below is the only place where a form is turned
into the `Fin`-indexed `ExplicitPotential.AffineForm` the existing certificate
layer speaks: `toAffineForm` reads the coefficients out of the list with
`getD`, so no `![…]` and no `Matrix.cons` ever appears.

## Where the soundness hazard is discharged

`RESULTS.md` §9 records that on a core carrying a loop the core vertices are
*not* rank determining, so the strong-separator step is unsound there.  In
this file that hazard is discharged in exactly one place: `censusSpec`'s
`rep_loopless` field, which is supplied by the row obligation's own
`¬ IsLoopy` census hypothesis through
`ContractionForestCensusGeneral.rep_loopless_of_not_isLoopy`.  Every
downstream separator fact (`DegSpec.strongSeparatorCertificate`) is
hypothesis-free precisely *because* a `DegSpec` cannot be built without that
field.  Dropping `hNotLoopy` from `leaf_sound` is therefore not possible: the
conclusion does not typecheck without it.

## What the checker accepts, and what it deliberately refuses

`Witness` is the spec's §4.3 record verbatim (chips, a block list per slot,
head/tail slack).  `Witness.leafChecks` is **fail-closed** on the parts of
that record whose Lean support does not exist yet:

* it requires `chips = []`, and
* it requires exactly one block per slot (`k_e = 1`),

so that no named interior point ever arises.  With `k_e = 1` there are no
interior named points, W1's slack and W4's interior residual are vacuous, and
W5 collapses to the per-core-vertex integer test `ValidClosed` already makes.

This is not a toy restriction: it is exactly the leaf the implemented
generator emits.  the proof-data source's `verify_leaf` checks precisely
`lo_e ≤ hi_e`, `lo_e·ℓ_e ≤ F(head e) − F(tail e) ≤ hi_e·ℓ_e`, and the core
residual, and all four leaves in the proof-data source (`banana3`,
`g4row002`, `g4row010`, `g4row011`) have `(chips)` empty and one `(b …)` per
slot.  The multi-block half of §4.3 is unexercised by every accepted proof in
the catalog; see the note at the end of this file for what it would cost.

/-! ## §7  The root of a `(domain closed)` proof

Spec §4.1: the root context is the closed orthant `[σ_0, …, σ_{p−1}]` with no
equalities.  Specialising `leaf_sound` there removes `point`, `hΓ` and `hlen`
and leaves exactly the row obligation of §3: *for every* `ℓ : Fin p → ℕ` whose
vanishing set is a non-loopy forest, the goal holds. -/

  ge := (List.range p).map coordForm

/-! ## §8  What the multi-block half of §4.3 would cost

Spec §5.3 calls the leaf "composition, not new mathematics" and points at
`Certificate/SlopeScript.lean` and `Certificate/AffinePositionMultiBreak.lean`
for the multi-break script.  That is only true on the **open** orthant: both
of those modules are stated for `SubdivisionGraph.Spec`, which carries
`length_pos`, whereas the leaf obligation of a `(domain closed)` proof lives
on `Utilities.Certificate.DegenerateSpec.DegSpec`, where lengths may vanish.  The closed-orthant
script layer that exists is
`Utilities.Certificate.DegenerateSpec.DegSpec.interpolatedScript` — *one* affine interpolation per
slot, i.e. exactly `k_e = 1`.

So supporting `k_e ≥ 2` needs a genuinely new construction: a piecewise-affine
script on `DegSpec` whose break positions are affine forms that may collide
with each other and with the two endpoints, plus its `prin` at interior and
core vertices, plus the `α_e`/`ω_e` slack reading of W5.  That is the
`DegSpec` port of `SlopeScript` + `AffinePositionMultiBreak`, and it is where
W4 (which is vacuous here) starts doing work.

Nothing in the catalog needs it yet: the proof-data source only ever
emits one block per slot, and §13.5 proves that a *single* whole-orthant leaf
on a two-edge-connected core with more core vertices than degree cannot exist
at all — those rows need a chamber split or an interior chip, which is the
tree layer and the chips, not more blocks. -/
