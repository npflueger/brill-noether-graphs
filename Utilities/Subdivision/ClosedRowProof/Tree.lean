# The row-proof tree layer, deep-embedded

Step C of the proof-data source needs a way to lower a `SPLIT` node.  `NEXT.md`
proposed lowering it *shallowly*, as a generated `rcases le_or_gt`; this file
takes the deep-embedded route instead, for the same reason the corresponding closed-row proof module
deep-embeds the arithmetic:

* the whole tree becomes one piece of data and one `decide`, instead of one
  `decide` per leaf plus a generated tactic script whose size is the number of
  nodes — for `g4row099` that is 64 leaves and 63 splits;
* the accumulated context at a leaf is *computed* by `PTree.checks` rather than
  transcribed by the emitter, so the emitter cannot get it wrong;
* the `rcases le_or_gt` of the shallow plan survives verbatim, once, inside
  `PTree.sound` below, where it is proved rather than generated.

The tree layer is deliberately minimal: `SPLIT`, `LEAF`, `USE`, `AUTO`,
`ABSURD`, and the one `REDUCE` opcode whose Lean theorem exists on the closed
orthant, `REDUCE CUTVERTEX`.  Spec §4.2's other opcodes (`SPLIT3`, `MOD`,
`CITE`, and the other `REDUCE` operations) are absent on purpose — spec
§13.6's rule is that a node shape is a reject until its Lean theorem exists,
and adding a constructor here with no soundness case would break `PTree.sound`
rather than silently weaken it.

## `ABSURD`

`(absurd cert)` discharges an *empty* cell: `cert` is a Farkas derivation of
`−1 ≥ 0` from the accumulated context, so no point satisfies the context and
the row's conclusion holds there vacuously.  This is the same `Cert` and the
same `Cert.check_sound` as everywhere else — the only novelty is that the form
entailed is the constant `falseForm = −1` rather than something the leaf needs.

It is not a luxury.  Splitting a chamber finely produces empty cells as the
normal case, so a cover of any size contains them in quantity; a tree layer
without `ABSURD` can only lower covers that were pruned by hand.

`AUTO` is closed-face sound, not merely an interior-cone shortcut.  Its raw
permutations are checked against the core, its context forms are pulled back
by the slot permutation, and `ClosedAuto.bnExists_iff` transports through the
quotient classes created by zero slots.  Named-subtree soundness is therefore
kept uniform in the length vector: an auto-wrapped `use` may invoke the same
subtree at the reindexed metric and then transport the result back.

## `USE`, and the shape change it forces

`(use k cert_0 … cert_{m-1})` cites the *earlier* named subtree `k`.  A subtree
carries an **entry context** — a list of forms it may assume on top of the root
domain — and the citing node must show that the context accumulated at the
citation entails every one of them.  That is pure context weakening, and
`Cert.check_sound` is exactly the entailment half of it.

So `use` cannot be checked against a tree alone: the checker has to know what
the earlier subtrees claim.  `PTree.checksIn` therefore threads a list `E` of
entry contexts, `PProof` bundles an ordered list of subtrees with a main tree,
and `subsCheck` walks the subtrees in order, each seeing only its predecessors.
That ordering is what makes the recursion well-founded and is verbatim
`rpfcheck.c`'s "`use` must reference an earlier subtree".

`PTree.checks` is kept as the `E = []` specialisation, so a proof with no
subtrees — every row in the catalog that predates this — lowers to exactly the
same term it did before.

The payoff is that a chamber cover whose cells reuse the same local witness
stores and *checks* that witness once: on row 099 the 64 materialized leaves
become 15 subtrees plus 64 entailment citations.

## `REDUCE CUTVERTEX`

`(reduce cutvertex v c_0 … c_{p-1})` names an articulation vertex `v` and
two-colours the slots.  the proof-data source verifies that the colouring
really does split the core at `v` into two connected positive-genus factors
meeting only there, and then cites the factorwise gluing theorem.  On the Lean
side that citation is
`RowProof.bnExists_censusSpec_of_genusFourRankOneCheck`, the closed-orthant
port of `Certificate/CoreVertexCutGenusFour.lean`'s theorem, whose conclusion
is verbatim `PTree.sound`'s at `degree = 3`.

Three things make the fit exact rather than approximate.

* The Lean checker is `CoreVertexCut.Data.genusFourRankOneCheck`, which
  re-derives the cut, the two factor genera, and — on a genus-one factor — the
  two-regularity that `PointedGenusOneRigid` needs.  The colouring is *not*
  trusted: `CutData` carries raw `ℕ`s, `toCut` decodes them totally, and the
  checker validates the decoding.  A `.rpf` colouring that does not in fact
  cut the core is simply rejected by `decide`.
* The gluing theorem is **specific to `degree = 3`**, unlike the rest of
  `PTree.sound`, which is generic in `degree`.  `CutData.checks` therefore
  demands `degree = 3` outright rather than papering over the difference.
* The node's conclusion is unconditional — it holds on the whole closed
  orthant — so `CutData.checks` ignores the accumulated context `Γ`.  That is
  sound in the safe direction: the node proves more than its chamber needs.

## The context discipline

`SPLIT g` pushes `g` in the first branch and `−1 − g` in the second; over the
integers those are exhaustive, and that is the entire coverage argument (spec
§4.2).  New rows are appended at the **end** of `Γ.ge`, so a context row's
index never changes as the tree descends: at a leaf of a depth-`k` branch the
root's `p` coordinate rows still sit at indices `0 … p−1` and the branch
conditions at `p … p+k−1`.  That stability is what lets the emitter address
context rows by a fixed index in every certificate it synthesises.

/-! ## The `REDUCE CUTVERTEX` node

`PTree` is core-independent — it is one inductive type, not a family indexed by
`(n, p, core)` — so a `cutvertex` node cannot carry a `CoreVertexCut.Data core`
directly.  It carries raw `ℕ` data instead, and `toCut` / `toTree` decode it
against whatever core the checker is run at.  Decoding is **total**: out-of-range
indices are reduced `% n` or `% p` and missing list entries default to `0`,
exactly as the generated `core` itself decodes its `tail`/`head` lists.  Nothing
about the decoded data is believed; `genusFourRankOneCheck` re-derives every
condition the gluing theorem needs. -/

/-- Raw data for a `(reduce cutvertex …)` node: the articulation vertex and one
side of the cut, plus a rooted spanning tree witnessing core connectivity.

The `.rpf` carries only `glue` and the slot colouring; `left` is the colouring
converted to a vertex set, and the four tree fields are synthesised by the
emitter.  Both conversions are validated by the checker rather than trusted. -/

Each subtree is checked in scope of its predecessors' entry contexts only, so
the accumulated soundness fact grows by one entry at a time and never appeals
to a subtree that has not yet been proved.  This is where `rpfcheck.c`'s

An accepted tree at the closed root proves the goal on every face of the closed
length orthant whose vanishing set is a non-loopy forest — that is, on every
subdivision of the core *and* every equal-genus contraction of one.  Compare
