# The multi-break interpolated script

`AffinePositionMultiBreak` names a passive multi-break slope script by a
list of affine-positioned breaks and computes its Laplacian exactly: the
endpoint sum at a core vertex, the jump of the break list at an interior
vertex, and in particular the *vanishing* of that jump away from every
named break. What it does **not** yet supply is the value *at* a named
break, or the small amount of vertex-by-vertex bookkeeping (`effective`,
`Reaches`) that every concrete instance of it would otherwise have to
restate. Both are entirely row-independent, so both are proved here once,
directly on top of `AffinePositionMultiBreak` (component 1).

* **Sorted break lists.** `SegmentReflection.value`/`slope` hard-code a
  three-piece step function (down, flat, up), and
  `GenusFourCore100.rampSlope`/`capSlope` hard-code two- and three-piece
  step functions via `min`/`max`. The multi-break format of component 1
  allows an arbitrary number of pieces, named by an arbitrary (unsorted)
  list; `BreakSorted` isolates the case that every script actually produces
  — start positions strictly increasing along the list — and
  `breakSlope_eq_of_breakSorted` gives, once, for any number of pieces, the
  same kind of closed form those files hard-code by hand: the value of a
  sorted break list at one of its own start positions is exactly that
  entry's slope. The supporting lemma `breakSlope_append_cons_eq` is more
  general still: it needs no global sortedness, only that nothing *after*
  the chosen entry in list order also starts at or before the query point.

* **March data.** `AffinePosition.SlopeScript.MarchData` bundles the closing
  balance condition of `AffinePosition.SlopeScript.Balanced` with sortedness
  on every slot — the affine-positioned analogue of
  `GenusFourCore100.RampData`, generalized from one window per slot to an
  arbitrary sorted sequence of them. `sortedBreaks_of_coordinate_lt` gives a
  convenient sufficient condition for sortedness (breaks listed in
  increasing coordinate order by script index), and
  `prin_firingScript_atBreak` computes the Laplacian of a march at one of
  its own named breaks in closed form, generalizing
  `GenusFourCore100.rampSlope_diff`/`capSlope_diff` to an arbitrary sorted
  sequence of breaks.

* **Effectiveness and reachability bookkeeping.** `effective_of_cases` and
  `reaches_of_script`, restated verbatim in every direct genus-four row
  (`GenusFourCore100.lean` etc.) for its own fixed `n, p`, are proved once
  here for an arbitrary `SubdivisionGraph.Spec n p`, so no row needs to
  restate them again.

Nothing here is row specific, and nothing here is decidable-by-`decide`: the
only Boolean checks anywhere in the stack are the fail-closed bound checks
already introduced by `AffinePosition`.
