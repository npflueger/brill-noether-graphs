# Integer interpolation along a subdivided edge

This file isolates the arithmetic needed to turn integral endpoint potentials
into a convex integral potential on a path.  It deliberately contains no graph
construction.

For a positive length `L` and an integral rise `T`, write

`T = q * L + r`, with `0 <= r < L`.

The potential below has slope `q` for the first `L - r` unit steps and slope
`q + 1` for the final `r` steps.  Thus it has endpoint values `0` and `T`, and
its slopes are nondecreasing.  The sign convention is chosen for the future
chip-firing application: at an interior path vertex, `prin` will be the next
slope minus the previous slope.
