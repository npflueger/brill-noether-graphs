# Doubled-anchor rows for an explicit-potential certificate

Two executable rows that a *marked* leaf needs and an unmarked one does not:

* `dominatesMarkCheck` — the certificate's core divisor carries at least
  `chips` chips at a distinguished vertex, and nothing negative anywhere.  This
  is `W7` read at a mark.
* `multResidualCheck` — the `W5` residual table read with multiplicity `mult`
  at an anchor rather than with multiplicity one.  `multTargetCoefficient` is
  the single arithmetic definition it needs, and it is `targetCoefficient` on
  the nose at `mult = 1`.

Both are `allFin`/`decide` Booleans over `Fin n`, so an emitter discharges them
on concrete data and the kernel replays them.  Each comes with the `Prop` it
characterizes and an `iff`, so a consumer may use either form.

These lived in `MarkedGraphs/Certificate/DegenerateDoubledAnchor.lean` until
2026-08-31.  Nothing about them is specific to a genus, a row, or a
marked-graph existence statement, and the generic row-proof checker under
`Utilities/Subdivision/ClosedRowProof/` needs them to state its marked leaf
checkers, so they belong on this side of the boundary.  The *soundness*
theorems that consume them — `effective_degenerateDivisor_sub_smul_one_chip`,
`class_mult_balance_nonnegative`,
`winnable_sub_smul_one_chip_degenerateCoreVertex` — stay private, where their
only consumers are.
