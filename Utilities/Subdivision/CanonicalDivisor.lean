# Canonical divisors on positive subdivisions

The canonical coefficient at a core vertex is its incidence degree minus
two; every subdivision-interior coefficient is zero. Thus leaflessness can
be checked on the finite core. Degree and rank depend only on the numbers
of core vertices and slots. In particular a connected specification with
one more slot than core vertices has a canonical divisor of degree two and
rank one.

The valence calculations are reused from `Utilities.Gluing.CycleRigidity`.
All statements here concern positive `SubdivisionGraph.Spec` objects, not
contracted zero-length faces.
