# Two-edge connectivity of one-vertex-cut factors

Complement symmetry of `cutMultiplicity`, inheritance of the two-edge cut
condition by both factors of a `OneVertexCut`, and the two-vertex lower bound
for positive genus.  Rehomed from `OnceMarkedVertexCutOneFour.lean` (which
imports this file) so that the bridgeless genus-two classification does not
depend on the once-marked census.
