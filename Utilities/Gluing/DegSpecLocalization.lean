# Localizing a guarding picture to one chip-free component

`AtanasovRanganathan.Guarding.GuardingSet` asks, for every chip-free core
vertex `v` and every degenerate spec `d` over the core, for

    Reaches d.graph (d.coreClassDivisor chips) (d.coreVertex v).

Every picture in the library discharges that by exhibiting a firing script on
the whole of `d.graph` and checking its residual there.  That is why the
library's pictures are indexed by the *ambient* core and not by the shape of
the component being guarded: a component of four vertices sitting in a
ten-vertex core has to have its Dhar arithmetic rewritten from scratch.

This file supplies the alternative.  `reaches_coreVertex_of_induced_script`
is the same conclusion, but its arithmetic hypothesis lives on the induced
subgraph cut out by a vertex set `A` -- typically the component together with
the chip vertices it hangs from.  The only extra obligation is that the script
vanish at the vertices of `A` which have an edge leaving `A`.

`interior_of_steps` is the combinatorial criterion which discharges the
interiority obligation on a subdivision: a vertex is interior to `A` as soon
as every unit step touching it has its other end in `A`.

## What this buys

A component's picture becomes a statement about the component, provable once
and reusable in every ambient core the shape occurs in.  Concretely, the
genus-six "two-banana chain" (auxiliary calculations Sec. 5a)
occupies six of core 46's ten vertices; localizing to it replaces a genus-six
Dhar calculation by a genus-two one with two frozen endpoints.

## Layering

`Utilities` only: `DegSpec` already lives here, so `LowGenus` picture files
may use this directly.

/-- **The shape of a guarding discharge, localized.**

This is `GuardingSet.guard`'s conclusion, obtained from a local Dhar move
computed inside the induced subgraph on `A`.  `hOff` is free for a chip
assignment, since `coreClassDivisor` of nonnegative weights is effective. -/
