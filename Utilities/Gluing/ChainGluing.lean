# Iterated vertex gluing and the chain transmission theorem

This is the assembly layer for Section 6 of the twice-marked banana paper: the
iterated vertex gluing of a chain of twice-marked graphs, and the transport of
`TransmissionExistence` along it.

## What is here and what it rests on

`TransmissionWedgeDemazure` already proves the two-factor step: opposite-side
wedge addition composes two transmission witnesses by the Demazure product
(`satisfiesTransmission_wedgeAddDivisor_star`, the paper's `eq:tauGlued`), and
the existential form of the same
(`transmissionExistence_vertexWedge_opposite_of_factorizations`) is conditional
on one named input, `HasBoundedDemazureFactorizations`: every finite ASP
permutation whose inversion length fits inside `gG + gH` splits as a Demazure
product of two factors of lengths at most `gG` and `gH`.

This file iterates that step along a chain, so the chain theorem is reduced to
exactly the same single input and nothing else.  `chainTransmissionExistence`
below is the ℓ-fold statement; the two-factor case is the existing theorem.

The bounded factorization property is an explicit hypothesis of this module's
general gluing theorem. `Demazure.Avoiding321.dprod_eq_iff` supplies the
factorization criterion used by its consumers.

## Universes

`vertexWedge` lands in `CFGraph.{max u v}`, so iterating it in full universe
generality would raise the level at every step.  Everything here therefore
works with all factors in a single fixed universe, where the wedge is closed.

/-- The bounded Demazure factorization input, at every pair of budgets.

`HasBoundedDemazureFactorizations` is stated for one pair `(gG, gH)`; the

/-- **Chain gluing for transmission existence.**

If every factor of a chain has transmission existence at its own two marks,
then so does the whole chain at the two outer marks.  This is the ℓ-fold form
of `transmissionExistence_vertexWedge_opposite_of_factorizations`, and rests on
the same single input.

This is the transmission half of `thm:bngChain` (Theorem 1.13). -/

/-- **Chain gluing for once-marked Brill--Noether existence.**

The once-marked corollary of the chain theorem: if the chain's transmission
existence holds and the ASP permutation attached to a partition has the
Grassmannian profile, then the glued graph realizes that partition at its left
mark.

This is the shape in which `thm:bngChain` is used downstream — the partition
side is supplied by `transmissionExists_iff_onceMarkedBNExists`, the chain side
by `chainTransmissionExistence`. -/
