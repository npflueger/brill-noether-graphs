# Rank one across a positive-genus articulation in genus five

The unmarked genus-five structural exit is considerably simpler than its
once-marked ancestor.  The two factors have genera `(1,4)` or `(2,3)`, up to
order.  The genus-at-most-three factor carries its elementary critical pencil,
the genus-four factor uses the supplied genus-four theorem, and bridge gluing
followed by contraction of the artificial bridge loses exactly one degree.
