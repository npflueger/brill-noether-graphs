# A one-vertex cut is the free case of the transport lemma

`Utilities.Gluing.reaches_of_induced_script` localizes a picture to an induced
subgraph at the price of freezing the script on the boundary.  This file
records that a `OneVertexCut` is exactly the case where that price is zero:
the cut's `no_cross` field says the glue vertex is the *only* vertex of `left`
with an edge leaving `left`, and a script may always be normalised to vanish at
one prescribed vertex.

So the transport lemma subsumes the vertex-wedge delivery statement, and this
file is the machine-checked form of that claim.  What the transport lemma adds
beyond it is the case of a larger boundary, which a `OneVertexCut` cannot
express and which is what a chip-free component of a two-edge-connected core
actually presents.
