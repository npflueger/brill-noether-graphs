# Transporting a local Dhar move out of an induced subgraph

A configuration picture is a firing script together with a proof that the
residual it leaves is effective.  Every picture in the library is written on
the *whole* graph, and that is why the library has no picture for a component
whose shape is understood but whose ambient graph is large: the arithmetic has
to be redone in the ambient graph.

This file removes that obstacle.  Fix a vertex set `A`.  Call a vertex
`Interior G A` when *every* ambient edge at it stays inside `A`; the vertices
of `A` that are not interior are its boundary.  The observation is:

> A firing script whose support consists of interior vertices acts on the
> ambient graph exactly as its restriction acts on the induced subgraph `G[A]`,
> and does nothing at all outside `A`.

Hence a local Dhar move performed inside `G[A]` -- subject only to the side
condition that the script vanish on the boundary of `A` -- proves the ambient
reachability statement, provided the ambient divisor is effective off `A`.
`reaches_of_induced_script` is that theorem.

## Why this is the gluing lemma

When `A` has a **single** boundary vertex `g`, the side condition costs
nothing: firing scripts matter only up to a constant, so any script may be
normalised to vanish at `g`.  That special case is exactly the vertex-wedge
delivery statement (`Utilities.OneVertexCut`, `winnable_vertexWedge_iff_exists_chipShift`),
and `reaches_of_induced_script_of_unique_boundary` states it in this language.

The general form is strictly stronger, and the strength is what pictures need:
`A` may have *any* number of boundary vertices, so the ambient graph need not
have a cut vertex at all.  A chip-free component sitting inside a
two-edge-connected ambient graph still localises, at the price of the boundary
vertices being frozen -- which, read as a divisor statement, says that a
boundary vertex may deliver into `A` only the chips it already carries.

/-! ## The transport theorem -/

/-- **A local Dhar move inside `G[A]` proves ambient reachability.**

The hypotheses are exactly three:

* the ambient divisor is effective away from `A` (nothing outside is spent);
* the target lies in `A`;
* the script is supported on interior vertices -- equivalently, it vanishes on
  the boundary of `A`.

Under them, an effective residual computed entirely inside the induced
subgraph `G[A]` is an effective ambient residual. -/
