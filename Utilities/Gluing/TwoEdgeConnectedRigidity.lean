# Degree-one rigidity from two-edge-connected cuts

For the pointed genus-one wedge argument, the remaining cycle input is that
distinct vertices determine distinct degree-one divisor classes.  This file
proves a graph-level sufficient condition: every nonempty proper vertex cut
has total outgoing multiplicity at least two.

If `(y) - (p)` were principal, choose the maximum level set of a firing script
with principal divisor `(p) - (y)`.  The vertex `p` cannot lie in that set.
At every other maximum except possibly `y`, the level-set inequality forces
out-degree zero; at `y` it forces out-degree at most one.  Thus the whole cut
has size at most one, contradicting the hypothesis.
