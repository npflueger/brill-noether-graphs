# Genus-four rank one across a one-vertex cut

The two structural alternatives used by the finite genus-four cut checker are
entirely graph-theoretic.  Two genus-two factors glue with one chip saved;
a genus-three factor and a pointed rigid genus-one factor glue without adding
a chip.  This module keeps those statements in the public gluing layer.
