# Reusable Atanasov--Ranganathan configuration moves

The seven pictures in Atanasov--Ranganathan, Lemma 4.1, are local Dhar
calculations.  This file records the common proof interface independently of
those pictures: a configuration supplies an integral firing script whose
removed-chip residual is effective, hence a `StrongSeparator.Reaches` fact.

Two geometric patterns are isolated here.

* A segment configuration starts with one chip at each endpoint and uses an
  exact two-endpoint reflection to reach a named point of the segment.  The
  `min(a,b)` and `a-b` positions occurring in configurations six and seven
  are exposed through `MovingPosition`.
* The doubled-path configuration is fully discharged using the interpolated
  truncated-ramp potential already proved in `GenusFourLoopLemma`.

The paper's diagrams do not specify an ordered core-slot encoding, edge
orientations, or which dashed half-edge continues outside each solid
configuration.  Consequently this module does not assert that a numbered
picture, or Core 095, has been encoded.  It gives the reusable checked moves
to which such incidence data must eventually be connected.
