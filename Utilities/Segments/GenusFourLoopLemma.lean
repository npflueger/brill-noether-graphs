# A loop-split interface for the genus-four loop lemma

Atanasov--Ranganathan contract two topological loops, use genus two on the
contracted graph, and then lift the resulting degree-three divisor back across
the loops.  In the certificate model a topological loop is represented by a
bivalent core marker joined to its base by two subdivided edge slots.

This file formalizes the rank-theoretic end of that argument.  The embedded
core is already known to be a strong separator, so it is enough to reach the
original core vertices and the loop markers.  Reaching a marker can in turn
be split into two small pieces: a representative carrying two chips at the
loop base and the standard degree-two reflection move on the loop.

The remaining geometric input for the full loop lemma is deliberately visible
in the hypotheses of `bnExists_three_of_two_loop_split_witness`: one must
construct the two-chip representatives after contracting the loops and prove
the reflection move uniformly for two subdivided paths of arbitrary positive
lengths.  Neither assertion is silently delegated to generated data here.
