# Brambles and the bramble number

A **bramble** of a simple graph `H` is a collection of connected vertex sets
that pairwise *touch*: any two of them have connected union.  A **hitting set**
meets every member, and the **order** of the bramble is the least size of a
hitting set.  Seymour--Thomas duality says the largest order of a bramble is
`treewidth H + 1`; the half of that used here is proved in
`TreewidthGonality/Treewidth/SeymourThomas.lean`.

## Conventions

Connectivity of a vertex set is `(H.induce (↑S : Set V)).Connected`, as fixed in
the module docstring of `TreewidthGonality/Treewidth/TreeDecomposition.lean`.  Since
`SimpleGraph.Connected` bundles `Nonempty`, the `connected_mem` field already
forces every member of a bramble to be nonempty (`Bramble.nonempty_of_mem`), so
there is no separate nonemptiness field.

`order` is an `sInf` over `ℕ`; `hittingSetCards_nonempty` (all of `V` is a
hitting set) is what makes it meaningful rather than the `sInf ∅ = 0` default.

/-- A **bramble** of `H`: a finite family of vertex sets, each inducing a
connected subgraph, any two of which have connected union ("they touch").

Taking `B = B'` in `touching` recovers `connected_mem`, so the latter is
redundant; it is kept because it is the field consumers use and because it makes
the definition read the way the literature states it. -/

This is the combinatorial content of `touching` and is what
`TreewidthGonality/Gonality/BrambleGonality.lean` consumes when it builds a hitting set
out of a cut.

Proved (2026-08-25): `touching B hB B' hB'` gives a walk inside `↑(B ∪ B')` from
a vertex of `B` to a vertex of `B'` (both are nonempty).  If `B ∩ B' = ∅` the
endpoint of that walk is outside the subtype-level set `{x | ↑x ∈ B}`, so
`exists_adj_across_of_walk` produces an edge of the induced graph with one end in
`B` and the other in `(B ∪ B') ∖ B = B' ∖ B`; `SimpleGraph.comap_adj` pushes it
back down to an edge of `H`. -/
