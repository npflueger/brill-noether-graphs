# Seymour--Thomas duality

The Seymour--Thomas theorem ("brambles and tree width", J. Combin. Theory Ser. B
58 (1993)) says that the maximum order of a bramble of `H` equals
`treewidth H + 1`.  `TreewidthGonality/Gonality/TreewidthGonality.lean` consumes the
existence of a bramble whose order is exactly `treewidth H + 1`.

This module assembles that statement from
`TreewidthGonality/Treewidth/SeymourThomasInduction.lean`, which proves the hard half
(some bramble has order **at least** `treewidth H + 1`) following
Bellenbaum--Diestel, *Two short proofs concerning tree-decompositions*, §4.

## Why the easy half is not proved

Getting order *exactly* `treewidth H + 1` classically needs the other
inequality: every bramble is covered by some bag, so no bramble has order above
`treewidth H + 1`.  Its proof orients every edge of the decomposition tree
towards the side that covers the bramble and takes the end of a maximal directed
path — a second consumer of Bellenbaum--Diestel's Lemma 1.

It is avoidable.  The order of a bramble is monotone in its member family
(`Bramble.order_restrict_le`) and increases by at most one when a single member
is adjoined (`Bramble.order_le_succ_erase`: a hitting set of the smaller family
plus one vertex of the new member hits the larger one).  Peeling members off one
at a time therefore realizes **every** value between `0` and the order, so a
bramble of order `≥ treewidth H + 1` contains a sub-bramble of order exactly
`treewidth H + 1`.  That is `exists_subfamily_order_eq` below, and it is
strictly cheaper than the easy half of duality.

`M' := M`.  Otherwise `m < (restrict M).order`, so `M` is nonempty
(`order_restrict_empty`); pick `B ∈ M` and apply the induction hypothesis to
