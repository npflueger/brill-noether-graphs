# Tree decompositions and treewidth

Mathlib has no treewidth as of 2026-08-25, so this module introduces it from
scratch, in the shape needed by the van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt theorem
`treewidth ≤ gonality` (`TreewidthGonality/Gonality/TreewidthGonality.lean`).

## The connectivity convention (binds every downstream module)

Two conventions were available for "the vertex set `S` induces a connected
subgraph of `H`": `SimpleGraph.Subgraph` connectivity, and the induced graph
on the coercion of `S` to a `Set`.  **This library uses the induced-graph
form throughout**:

```
(H.induce (↑S : Set V)).Connected
```

for `S : Finset V`, and likewise for subsets of the tree's node type.  Reasons:

* `SimpleGraph.induce` produces an honest `SimpleGraph ↥s`, so the whole
  `SimpleGraph.Connected`/`Walk`/`Reachable` API applies verbatim with no
  `Subgraph.verts` side conditions;
* `SimpleGraph.Connected` already bundles `Nonempty`, which is exactly the
  nonemptiness condition brambles need, so one field does two jobs;
* the coercion `↑S : Set V` keeps the `Finset` bookkeeping (cardinalities,
  `Finset.filter`) available on the other side of the statement.

`TreewidthGonality/Treewidth/Bramble.lean` and `TreewidthGonality/Gonality/BrambleGonality.lean`
use the same form.  Do not mix in `Subgraph.Connected` without converting.

## Multigraph note

Treewidth is defined for a `SimpleGraph`.  For a chip-firing multigraph `G` the
intended instantiation is `underlyingSimpleGraph G`: parallel edges and loops do
not change treewidth, so nothing is lost.

## Contents

* `TreeDecomposition H` — a bundled tree decomposition: a finite tree together
  with bags satisfying vertex coverage, edge coverage, and coherence.
* `TreeDecomposition.width`, `treewidth` (an `sInf` over `ℕ`).
* `trivialDecomposition` — the one-bag decomposition, which makes the set of
  achievable widths nonempty; `treewidth_le_card_sub_one`.

/-- A **tree decomposition** of a simple graph `H`: a finite tree `tree` on a
node type `Node`, together with a `bag` of vertices at each node, such that

* `cover_vertex` — every vertex lies in some bag;
* `cover_edge` — the two endpoints of every edge lie in a common bag;
* `coherent` — for each vertex `v` the set of nodes whose bag contains `v`
  induces a connected (in particular nonempty) subtree.

`coherent` implies `cover_vertex` (connectedness bundles nonemptiness), but both
are kept: `cover_vertex` is the field callers actually use, and stating it
separately keeps the definition readable. -/
