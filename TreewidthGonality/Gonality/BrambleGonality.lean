# Theorem A: the bramble number bounds the gonality

This is §2 of van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt (arXiv:1407.7055): for every bramble
`𝔅` of a connected graph `G`,

```
order 𝔅 ≤ divisorialGonality G + 1.
```

Combined with Seymour--Thomas duality this gives `treewidth ≤ gonality`
(`TreewidthGonality/Gonality/TreewidthGonality.lean`), but the statement here is
*stronger and unconditional*: the bramble number of `G` is at least
`treewidth G + 1` for any graph, so this bound implies the treewidth one and
holds whether or not the duality theorem has been formalized.

## Conventions

Brambles live on `underlyingSimpleGraph G` — treewidth and brambles do not see
edge multiplicities. The chip-firing side does: `outdeg_S` and `edgeCut` count
**with multiplicity**, which only strengthens the inequalities used here
(more parallel edges make a cut more expensive, never less).

Connectivity of a vertex set is `((underlyingSimpleGraph G).induce (↑B : Set G.V)).Connected`,
the convention fixed in `TreewidthGonality/Treewidth/TreeDecomposition.lean`.

/-! ## The three lemmas of §2 -/

/-- **Lemma 2.2 (support containment).**  If firing `U` clears the support off a
connected set `B` that previously met the support, then `B` was contained in `U`.

Proved (2026-08-25); the paper's argument in two steps:

1. Chips outside the fired set never decrease
   (`le_set_firing_apply_of_not_mem`), so any
   `w ∈ B ∖ U` with `D w > 0` would still carry a chip after firing, contradicting
   `hmiss`.  Hence `B ∩ divisorSupport D ⊆ U`, and by `hmeet` the intersection
   `B ∩ U` is nonempty.
2. If `B ⊄ U`, connectedness of `B` gives an edge of `underlyingSimpleGraph G`
   inside `B` with one end `u ∈ U` and the other end `w ∈ B ∖ U`
   (`Utilities.Treewidth.exists_adj_across_of_walk`).  Then
   `set_firing G D U w = D w + outdeg_S G Uᶜ w ≥ 0 + num_edges G w u > 0`, again
   contradicting `hmiss`.

Note no legality hypothesis is needed: only effectivity of `D` and the two
`set_firing_apply_*` formulas. -/

/-- **Lemma 2.3 (a cut separating two members bounds the order).**  If a bramble
has a member inside `U` and a member inside the complement of `U`, then its order
is at most one more than the number of edges crossing the cut.

Proved (2026-08-25) following the paper's §2 verbatim (Lemma 2.3 there, where the
containments are named the other way round: their `B'` is our `B`).

The naive hitting set "all endpoints of cut edges" has size
`edgeCut + (components of the cut graph)`, so it overshoots.  The paper's
construction, reproduced here, is **one endpoint per cut edge plus one extra
vertex**, and the choice that makes the case analysis close is:

* let `X`, `Y` be the two shores of the cut and, **among all members contained in
  `U`, let `B₀` be one whose trace `B₀ ∩ X` is inclusionwise minimal** (realized
  here by minimizing `(B₀ ∩ X).card`) — this is the step that is easy to miss and
  without which the lemma's case 1 is false;
* let `s` be any vertex of `B₀ ∩ X` (nonempty because `B₀` touches `B'`);
* for each cut edge `xy` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, select `x` if `x ∉ B₀` and `y`
  otherwise; `S` is the selection together with `s`, so `|S| ≤ edgeCut + 1`.

`S` hits every member `A`:

* `A ∩ Y = ∅`: then `A ⊆ U`, so `A` is a competitor for the minimality of
  `B₀ ∩ X`.  Either some `x ∈ (A ∩ X) ∖ B₀`, and then `x` was selected for its own
  cut edge, or `A ∩ X ⊆ B₀ ∩ X`, whence `A ∩ X = B₀ ∩ X` by minimality and
  `s ∈ A`.
* `A ∩ X = ∅`: then `A ⊆ Uᶜ`, and the cut edge joining `A` to `B₀` has its
  `U`-end in `B₀`, so its `Uᶜ`-end — a vertex of `A` — was selected.
* both nonempty: connectedness puts a whole cut edge inside `A`, and one of its
  ends was selected.

The multiplicity convention only helps: the cut is modelled by the finite set of
*ordered pairs* `(x, y) ∈ U × Uᶜ` with `num_edges > 0`, whose cardinality is at
most `edgeCut`. -/

/-! ## Theorem A -/

/-- **Theorem A** (van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt §2).  Every bramble of a
connected graph has order at most `divisorialGonality G + 1`.

Proved (2026-08-25); this is the main theorem of §2 of the paper.  The proof
narrative, matching the code line for line:

Let `d = divisorialGonality G`.  Among all effective divisors `D` of degree `d`
with `rank G D ≥ 1` (a nonempty finite-to-choose-from family: nonempty by
`exists_divisor_of_divisorialGonality`), choose one **maximizing the number of
members of `𝔅` that `divisorSupport D` hits**.  This is a finite extremal choice:
the quantity being maximized is `(𝔅.members.filter fun B => (B ∩ divisorSupport D).Nonempty).card`,
bounded by `𝔅.members.card`.

*Case 1: `divisorSupport D` hits every member.*  Then `divisorSupport D` is a
hitting set, so `𝔅.order ≤ (divisorSupport D).card ≤ deg D = d` by
`Bramble.order_le_card_of_isHittingSet` and `card_divisorSupport_le_deg` — even
better than claimed.

*Case 2: some member `B₀` is unhit.*  Pick `v ∈ B₀` (members are nonempty,
`Bramble.nonempty_of_mem`).  Run the nested legal chain of
`exists_nested_legal_chain` at `q = v`: sets `U 0 ⊆ U 1 ⊆ … ⊆ U (k-1) ⊆ univ.erase v`
with divisors `Dᵢ = fireChain G D U i`, every `Dᵢ` effective
(`fireChain_effective`), every `Dᵢ` linearly equivalent to `D`
(`fireChain_linear_equiv`, so `deg Dᵢ = d` and `rank G Dᵢ ≥ 1`), and `D_k`
`v`-reduced. By `one_le_apply_of_q_reduced_of_rank_geq_one`, `D_k v ≥ 1`, so
`D_k` **does** hit `B₀`.

Let `i` be the first index at which the family of members hit by `D` fails to be
contained in the family hit by `D_i`.  Such an `i` exists: otherwise the hit
family only grows along the chain, while `B₀` is newly hit at the end, so `D_k`
would hit strictly more members than `D`, contradicting the extremal choice of
`D` (`D_k` is a competitor: effective, degree `d`, rank `≥ 1`).  Note `i ≥ 1`
because `D_0 = D`.

Write `U = U (i-1)`, `B'` for the member hit by `D` (hence, by minimality of `i`,
also by `D_{i-1}`) and unhit by `D_i`.  Then:

* `support_containment` applied to `D_{i-1}`, `U`, `B'` gives `B' ⊆ U`;
* `B₀ ⊆ Uᶜ`, by the paper's *second* index: maximality of `D` also forces
  `B₀ ∩ supp D_{i-1} = ∅` (otherwise `D_{i-1}` hits strictly more members than
  `D`), and `B₀` is hit by `D_k`, so there is a first `j ≥ i-1` with
  `B₀ ∩ supp D_j = ∅` and `B₀ ∩ supp D_{j+1} ≠ ∅`.  Since firing `(U j)ᶜ` undoes
  firing `U j` (`set_firing_compl_set_firing`), `support_containment` applied to `D_{j+1}`
  and the fired set `(U j)ᶜ` gives `B₀ ⊆ (U j)ᶜ ⊆ (U (i-1))ᶜ` by nestedness.
* `hitting_of_cut` for the pair `(B', B₀)` gives `𝔅.order ≤ edgeCut G U + 1`;
* `charge_of_legal`/`edgeCut_le_deg_of_legal` for the legal set `U` at `D_{i-1}`
  gives `edgeCut G U ≤ deg D_{i-1} = d`.

Hence `𝔅.order ≤ d + 1` in both cases.

The extremal choice is realized as `Nat.sSup` of the (nonempty, bounded by
`𝔅.members.card`) set of achievable hit counts, which avoids having to know that
the family of competitors is finite. -/
