# `treewidth ≤ gonality`

The theorem of van Dobben de Bruyn--Gijswijt (arXiv:1407.7055): the treewidth of
a connected graph is at most its divisorial gonality.

The proof is the two-line composition of the repository's two halves:

* `Utilities.Gonality.bramble_order_le_gonality_succ` — Theorem A, the
  divisor-theoretic heart (`#print axioms` reports exactly
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`);
* `Utilities.Treewidth.exists_bramble_of_treewidth` — Seymour--Thomas duality,
  following Bellenbaum--Diestel's short proof; see
  `TreewidthGonality/Treewidth/SeymourThomas.lean`.

Both halves are unconditional, so `#print axioms` on the theorems below
reports exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
