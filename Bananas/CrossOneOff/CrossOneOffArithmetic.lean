# Arithmetic ranges for the cross one-off transmission block

This file isolates the meaning of "sufficiently long" in the both-off case
of Section 4.4.3 of the twice-marked banana paper.  If `n₁` is the length of the
second marked strand, the integral endpoint of the paper's rational interval

`b ≤ (n₁ / (n₁ - 1)) g`

is `g + g / (n₁ - 1)`.  The length assumption below is the exact uniform
threshold for the corrected block.  The three numerical bounds in Lemma 4.30
belong to three different congruence classes; in particular, its second bound
is not asserted for every integer below the cutoff.

/-- The exact length hypothesis simultaneously implies all three
numerical side conditions used in the corrected three residue cases of Lemma
4.30.  The first conclusion is only needed at positive multiples of `n₁`;
its strict form is the interior bound `b < n₁ (n₀ - 1)`.  The endpoint
allowed by the paper's weak inequality requires a separate rank argument.
The third inequality is stated over `ℤ`, as in the paper; natural subtraction
would silently truncate its negative left-hand side. -/
