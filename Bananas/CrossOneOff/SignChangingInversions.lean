# Sign-changing inversions

Section 6 of the twice-marked banana paper proves the chain theorem
(`thm:bngChain`, Theorem 1.13) through a single combinatorial estimate on the
Demazure product: `prop:sciInvStar` (6.13).  This file introduces the
statistic it is about and states the two results, with the paper's proofs
recorded as the plan for discharging them.

## Where this sits

The Lean development already has:

* `eq:tauGlued` — `Utilities.satisfiesTransmission_wedgeAddDivisor_star`;
* the two-factor and `ℓ`-fold gluing of transmission existence
  (`Utilities.ChainGluing`), conditional on a *factorization* property;
* `lem:tauChars` — `tauChars_rank_eq_southeast` and its northwest twin;
* the raw-`ℤ → ℤ`-to-`AspPerm` bridge (`Bananas/TransmissionBridge.lean`).

Note that `Utilities.ChainGluing` reaches the chain statement by a
*different* route from the paper: it asks for a length-budgeted factorization
`τ = α ⋆ β`, whereas the paper never factors, and instead bounds
`sci (α ⋆ β)` directly.  The `sci` route below is the paper's, and is the one
that does not require inventing a splitting.

## Status

Both estimates are proved, with no `sorry`.  This file proves the induction
for `prop:sciInvStar` (6.13) from a named `AffineReductionData k`; the companion
module `AffineReduction.lean` constructs that datum from the ordinary adjacent
descent theorem and a direct count of periodic inversion classes, and exports
the unconditional theorem `sci_star_le`.  The base case is
`sci_star_le_of_kInversionCount_eq_zero`.

`sci_star_sigma_le` (`lem-SciSimpleRefl`, 6.12) is unconditional.

Downstream: `prop:sciLambda` (6.10) relates `sci (τ_D)` to the Weierstrass
partition and needs `lem:tauChars` (available as `tauChars_rank_eq_southeast`
and its northwest twin) plus a Riemann-Roch telescoping sum;
`thm:glueBNGtoKGT` (6.6) is then 6.10 + 6.13 + `eq:tauGlued`;
`prop:glueMarked` (6.14) needs the wedge rank formula, available as
`Utilities.VertexWedgeRankFormula.vertexWedge_rank_ge_iff_profile_inequalities`;
and `thm:bngChain` (6.16) is the induction over the chain.

/-- Paper source: Definition 6.9.

A *sign-changing inversion* of `α` is a pair `u < v` with `α u > 0` and
`α v ≤ 0`.  Unlike an ordinary inversion this compares each value against the
fixed threshold `0` rather than against the other value. -/

/-- Paper source: Definition 6.9, the count `sci(α)`.

As with `kInversionCount`, `Set.ncard` is `0` on an infinite set, so every
statement below that bounds `sci` from above must either carry finiteness or be
read only for `α` where the set is finite.  For an almost-sign-preserving `α`
it is automatically finite. -/

/-! ## The pigeonhole core of Lemma 6.12

The whole content of `lem-SciSimpleRefl` is that an `α` with few sign-changing
inversions cannot flip sign twice within one residue class mod `k`.  That
statement involves neither the Demazure product nor `σ_S`, so it is isolated
here. -/

/-- Two sign flips of `α` at positions congruent mod `k` force `k - 1`
sign-changing inversions.

The injection is the paper's: for each `u` strictly between the two flip
positions, either `(u, m₂)` or `(m₁ + 1, u)` is a sign-changing inversion,
according to the sign of `α u`, and these are pairwise distinct. -/

/-- Paper source: `lem-SciSimpleRefl` (Lemma 6.12).

Composing with one `σ_S` whose support lies in a single residue class mod `k`
raises the sign-changing inversion count by at most one, as soon as
`sci α ≤ k - 2`.  The paper states this for `σ^k_n = σ_{n + kℤ}`; the only
property of that set the argument uses is that any two of its elements are
congruent mod `k`, so it is assumed directly.

Proof.  `Demazure.Transpositions.starSigma` (`eq:starSigma`, [PflDemProd, Thm
8.7]) replaces the Demazure product by the ordinary product with `σ_R`, `R` the
rising set.  `sci_comp_sigmaFun_le` then reduces the claim to `α` having at
most one flip position in `R`, and two flip positions congruent mod `k` would
give `k - 1` sign-changing inversions by
`sub_one_le_sci_of_two_signFlips`, contradicting `sci α ≤ k - 2`. -/

/-- Paper source: `prop:sciInvStar` (Proposition 6.13).

As long as the budget `k` strictly exceeds the two statistics combined, the
Demazure product does not overshoot their sum.  This is the estimate the whole
chain theorem rests on.

The induction is the paper's, on `inv_k β`: the base case is the `shift`
clause, and the inductive step splits off one affine simple reflection with
`reduce`, bounds its effect by `sci_star_sigma_le` (Lemma 6.12), and reapplies
the hypothesis to the smaller factor.  The budget survives the step because
6.12 costs one and the count drops by one. -/
