# The cross-one-off obstruction to general transmission

The exact-torsion theorem supplies the period separation that ordinary
inversion counting needs.  In the long-second-strand regime, the exceptional
order-two branch of the corrected torsion dichotomy is impossible, so a
`k`-general marking has `g ≤ k`.  The corrected decreasing block then has
more than `genus = g` inversions as soon as `g ≥ 7`.

/-- In the long-second-strand regime, `k`-general transmission forces the
period to be at least the genus.  This is the graph-theoretic separation
missing from a count based only on the forced rows of corrected Lemma 4.30.

The proof uses exactness of the `k`-general period and corrected Lemma 4.27.
Its order-two midpoint alternative cannot occur because the second mark is
the penultimate point of a strand of length at least `g+1 > 2`. -/

/-- The corrected Corollary 4.29 block directly rules out `k`-general
transmission in genus at least seven, under the explicit long-strand range
needed by the row calculation.

The threshold `7` is sharp for this particular block: it contributes
`choose (g-2) 2` inversions, which first exceeds the genus at `g=7`.
No claim about the still-unproved larger count of Corollary 4.31 is used. -/
