# The first transmission row for a same-strand one-off marking

This begins the formalization of Lemmas 4.23--4.25 for the marking consisting
of the left endpoint and the penultimate point of one strand.  The endpoint
reflection firing rewrites subtraction of the penultimate chip into banana
normal form.  At the divisor `g • rightEndpoint`, the resulting four ranks
give `rankDelta = 1`, hence the base transmission row `tau 0 = 0`.
