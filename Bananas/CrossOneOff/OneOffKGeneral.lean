# One-off general-transmission obstruction

This packages the corrected immediate inversion estimate following Lemma 4.23
with the defining inversion upper bound for `KGeneralTransmission`.  The
arithmetic hypothesis is deliberately explicit: it is exactly the condition
under which the paper's one-off row block is large enough to obstruct
generality.
