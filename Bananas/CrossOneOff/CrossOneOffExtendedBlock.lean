# An extended cross-one-off inversion block

When the second marked strand has length at least `g+2`, the corrected row
formula stays in its simple positive-residue case through row `g`.  Thus the
decreasing block extends from `2,...,g-1` to `2,...,g` and contributes
`choose (g-1) 2` inversions.

The generic counting lemma below also sharpens the period boundary in
`shifted_decreasing_block_inversion_lower_bound`: the largest *first*
coordinate is one less than the final block coordinate, so
`lo + length ≤ k` is enough.

/-- A shifted decreasing block whose final coordinate is at most `k`
contributes all pairwise inversions to `kInversions k tau`.  Equality at the
right endpoint is valid because it can occur only as the second coordinate
of one of the injected inversions. -/
