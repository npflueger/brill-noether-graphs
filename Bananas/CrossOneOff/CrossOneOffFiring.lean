# Firing identities for the cross-one-off marking

This file formalizes the chip-firing calculation behind Lemma 4.30 of
the twice-marked banana paper.  Coordinates are the normalized coordinates of
`strandVertex`.  Write `L,R` for the two multivalent vertices, put

`u = v_{α,1}`, `v = v_{β,N-1}`, and `b = mN+r`.

The common identity is

`gR + au - bv ~ (a-m-2)L + (g+m-b)R + v_{α,a} + v_{β,r}`.

It simultaneously fixes the residue convention and the two-off-by-one error
in the printed third case.  The three residue-specific corollaries below are
the divisor identities needed before applying the banana normal-form rank
calculus.
