# Corrected long-strand cross-one-off obstruction

The corrected Corollary 4.31 count, together with the strict period
separation, rules out `k`-general transmission in genus at least five as soon
as the second marked strand has length at least `g+1`.  This includes the
boundary length `g+1` omitted by the earlier extended-simple-block argument.

/-- **Corrected long-strand consequence of Corollary 4.31.**

For distinct cross-one-off marks, a second strand of length at least `g+1`
and the corrected long-first-strand range rule out `k`-general transmission
in every genus `g ≥ 5`.  The threshold is sharp for this count: at `g=4`
and `length beta = g+1`, its numerical lower bound equals `g`. -/
