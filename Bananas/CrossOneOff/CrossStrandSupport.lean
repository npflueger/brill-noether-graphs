# The support of a cross-strand two-chip divisor

Paper source: `cor:suppUV` (Corollary 3.8).  Two chips at interior points of
distinct strands of a banana have rank support exactly at those two points.

`ThetaNonrecurrence` proves this for `Banana 2`, as the geometric input to the
non-recurrence argument.  This file gives the general-genus statement.  The
interior half is `FarMarkAPI.rank_strand_pair_sub_of_distinct_interior`; what
had to be added is the two multivalent vertices, which the banana normal form
handles directly: deleting an endpoint from a semibreak divisor puts a `-1`
endpoint coefficient into the normal form, and such a divisor has rank `-1`.

/-- TeX label: `cor:suppUV` (Corollary 3.8), **general genus**.

Two chips at interior points of distinct strands of a banana of genus at least
two have rank support exactly at those two points.

`FarMarkAPI` already supplied `r(u + v - w) = -1` for every *interior* `w`
distinct from both marks; what completes the statement is the two multivalent
vertices, which the banana normal form handles directly: `u + v` is a
semibreak, so deleting an endpoint from it is a normal form with a negative
endpoint coefficient, and those have rank `-1`. -/
