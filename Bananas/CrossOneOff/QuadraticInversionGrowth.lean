# Explicit quadratic inversion growth on bananas

This gives the precise formal reading of the quantity `M` in Theorem 4.18:
there is a divisor whose affine transmission permutation has at least the
displayed number of normalized inversion classes.  The paper leaves
"sufficiently long" informal; the three theorems below retain the actual
verified length hypotheses for its endpoint, one-off, and cross-one-off
families.
