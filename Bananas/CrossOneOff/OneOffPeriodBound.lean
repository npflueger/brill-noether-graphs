# The affine-period bound for the same-strand one-off marking

The three residue formulas of Lemma 4.23 force every positive affine period
to lie strictly beyond `g + floor(g/(n-1))`, the exact natural-number form of
the paper's rational cutoff `(n/(n-1))g`.

`k`-affinity already exclude every positive `k` at or below the cutoff. -/
