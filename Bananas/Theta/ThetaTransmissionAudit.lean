# Bounded mechanical audit: evenly marked theta transmission

This file is intentionally disjoint from `Statements.lean` and all shared
helpers.  It records only reductions that compile from the current API.  In
particular, it is not an attempted proof of the theorem-level gaps.

/-! ## Exact names exposed by the current library

The following declarations are the complete generic route from a torsion
witness and all-submodularity to affine transmission and finite inversion
support.  Exact torsion for evenly marked theta graphs is now supplied by
`ThetaExactTorsionRelabel`; the generic API supplies no inversion-count bound.
-/

/-! The audit's point is that these API entry points exist with these
shapes.  Stated as anonymous `example`s rather than `#check`s: both are
compile-time checks, but `#check` prints an `info` on every build. -/

/-! ## Reduction of the evenly-marked theorem to the count inequality

Torsion, all-submodularity, existence of an affine transmission permutation,
and finiteness of its inversion set are already unconditional.  Thus the
only theta-specific input still needed is a bound for any affine
transmission permutation produced by the generic API. -/

/-! A witness at period two mechanically propagates to period four; this is
why an exact-order proof must establish minimality separately. -/

    TorsionWitness M 4 := by
  exact torsionWitness_of_dvd hk (by norm_num) (by norm_num)

/-! The remaining theta-specific ingredient is a genus-sized bound on
`kInversionCount k τ` for every affine transmission permutation.  The exact
torsion witness and its minimality are proved in `ThetaExactTorsionRelabel`;
all-submodularity and affine-transmission existence are already generic.

The paper obtains this bound through its genus-two inversion formula (Lemma
4.10) and nonrecurrence.  Neither has yet been formalized in the current API.
