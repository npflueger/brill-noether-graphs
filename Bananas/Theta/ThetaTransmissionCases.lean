exceptional rows below are graph-independent once their stated divisor-class
conditions hold.

/-- TeX label: `prop-thetaTransChar` (Proposition 4.5).

The complete rowwise transmission table for a rigid theta marking.  The four
exception predicates are the coordinate-free versions of the paper's classes
`2u`, `u+w`, `v+w`, and `v+\bar u`; the final implication is the exhaustive
default row.  Their mutual exclusivity is not needed to state or use the
table, since each implication is proved directly from the corresponding rank
difference. -/
