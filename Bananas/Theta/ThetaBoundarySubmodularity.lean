# Boundary submodularity on theta graphs

The interior part of paper Theorem 3.4 was already formalized in
`ThetaExceptionalArithmetic`.  This file treats the genuinely informative
boundary cases.  We first work in the subdivision spec's stored path
coordinates; normalized-coordinate wrappers are supplied below.

On a theta strand of length at least two, marking the stored-coordinate
initial endpoint and the penultimate vertex makes every divisor submodular.
The proof follows the paper's genus-two reduction.  A hypothetical negative
rank difference gives a one-chip auxiliary vertex `w`; the same-strand
interval theorem forces `w` to be either the penultimate vertex or the other
endpoint, while the reduction excludes both. -/

The two endpoints of a theta graph make every divisor submodular.  When the
auxiliary vertex lies on a strand stored in the same direction as the marked
strand, the exceptional-position interval is empty.  In the opposite stored
direction, the elementary endpoint-path rank calculation gives rank `-1`
directly. -/
