# Negative divisor classes on an interior-marked theta strand

This file formalizes the divisor-class bijection asserted in paper Theorem
3.4.  The source library exposes linear equivalence as an equivalence relation
but does not package its quotient, so we first introduce the corresponding
divisor-class type.  The main `Set.BijOn` theorem is stated in the raw
subdivision orientation, the coordinate system consumed by the existing exact
interval theorem.  Generic divisor-algebra wrappers keep its surjectivity
proof away from the concrete `one_chip` elaboration blowup.
