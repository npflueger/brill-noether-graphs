# Verified local input for theta torsion

The segment-reflection script gives the one-strand canonical-divisor identity
used in the paper's evenly-marked theta argument.  The stronger identity for
multiples of two marks is recorded below as an explicit remaining interface;
it is not assumed here.

/-! The raw prefix calculation behind the paper's `eq:multDiffMarkedPts`
is available from `ThetaPrefix`.  Its forward-oriented normalized adapter is
verified there; reversed slots still require the corresponding reflected
endpoint calculation. -/

/-! Normalized strand coordinates must be translated before applying any
raw-path firing identity.  In the reversed orientation, normalized position
`i` is stored at raw position `length - i`.  The adapter for this
(`normalizedPathPosition`, `strandVertex_eq_pathVertex_normalized`,
`normalizedPathPosition_isInterior`) lives in `BananaBasics.lean`; nothing
below this point ended up needing it directly. -/

/-- Paper source: `eq:multDiffMarkedPts` and `cor:evenlyMarkedKGT`; this is an
explicit contract for the currently missing graph-specific firing identity.

The exact graph lemma needed to finish the evenly-marked torsion proof.

For `B : Banana 2`, distinct strands `α ≠ β`, and interior positions `i,j`
with common rational ratio, put
`k = B.length α / gcd (B.length α) i.val`.  The paper's equation
`K - n(u-v) ~ reflected(ni) + (nj)` implies the following endpoint case at
`n = k`, hence the desired torsion witness.

This was originally a specification of a then-missing multi-strand
firing-script lemma.  It is now *discharged* by
`ThetaResidue.evenlyMarkedTheta_multiple_principal`, and
`Statements.evenlyMarkedTheta_torsion` is unconditional.  The named `Prop` is
kept only as the interface through which that discharge is routed.
