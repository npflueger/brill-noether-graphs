# Boundary negative divisor classes on theta graphs

This extends the class-valued bijection in Theorem 3.4 to the first genuine
boundary family: the first mark is the raw initial endpoint and the second is
an interior point at least two steps before the terminal endpoint.  The two
excluded terminal-near positions are precisely the all-submodular cases of
Corollary 3.6.
