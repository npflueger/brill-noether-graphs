# Twice-marked banana graphs: definitions

This is the paper-specific vocabulary for the twice-marked banana paper.  A banana
of genus `g` is represented by the existing positive subdivision model with
two core vertices and `g + 1` distinct edge slots.  Thus parallel strands are
retained by construction, rather than identified as a simple graph.

vertices. -/

/-- A concrete banana with prescribed positive strand lengths: the two-vertex
core with `g + 1` parallel strands, none of which is a loop.  This is the
coordinate-first constructor behind the notation `B_{n₀,…,nₑ}` and, at
`g = 2`, `θ_{a,b,c}`. -/

Submodularity of a divisor, including all of its marked twists. -/

/-- Paper source: `def-tauD` (Definition 2.11), the transmission permutation
`τ^{u,v}_D` characterised by `δ(τ(b) = a) = Δ(D + au - bv)`.

We keep the permutation as an integer function; bijectivity is stated here
instead of using a separate affine-permutation structure.  Note that the
main library models the same notion by `AspPerm` together with
`Utilities.SatisfiesTransmission`; the two presentations are not yet
connected by any lemma. -/

/-- Paper source: `def-inv` (Definition 2.13), the set `Inv_k(τ)`.

The paper's `k`-inversions are `k`-equivalence classes of inversions, where
`(a,b) ∼ (a',b')` iff `a - a' = b - b'` and `a ≡ a' (mod k)`.  Each class has
a unique representative with `0 ≤ a < k`, and this set of representatives is
what is recorded here. -/

/-- Paper source: Definition 1.10, `k`-general transmission.

Stated directly in terms of transmission permutations and their
`k`-inversion counts.  The `(kInversions k τ).Finite` conjunct is not
redundant decoration: `Set.ncard` is `0` on an infinite set, so without it
the count bound would be satisfied vacuously by a permutation with
infinitely many `k`-inversions.  (Finiteness is in fact automatic here — see
`kInversions_finite_of_isKAffine` — but only because of the other
conjuncts.) -/

/-- Paper source: Definition 1.3, i.e. part 2 of Conjecture 1.2.  Every pair
in the divisor census satisfies `ρ(g,r,d) ≥ 0`.

This is deliberately an implication and not an equivalence.  The converse
inclusion (every pair with `ρ ≥ 0` occurs) is part 1 of Conjecture 1.2, which
the paper records as open outside small genus.  Building it into the
definition would silently strengthen every hypothesis `BrillNoetherGeneral G`
and, more importantly, weaken every conclusion of the form
`¬ BrillNoetherGeneral G`. -/

/-- Paper source: the set `N_(G,u,v)` of `thm-NonSubmodGenus2` (Theorem 3.4),
for two marks `u = v_{α,i}`, `v = v_{α,j}` on one strand:
`{ v_{α,q} : q ≠ n_α - i, q ≠ j, j - i ≤ q ≤ j - i + n_α }`.

The bounds are stated over `ℤ`.  The paper places no order relation on `i`
and `j`, and with truncated `ℕ` subtraction the constraint `j - i ≤ q` would
collapse to `0 ≤ q` whenever `j < i`; the `ℕ` reading therefore only agrees
with the paper's set when `i ≤ j`. -/

/-- Paper source: `defn:evenlyMarked` (Definition 4.14).

Two interior marks on distinct theta strands divide their strands in the
same rational ratio.  Cross multiplication avoids a division convention. -/
