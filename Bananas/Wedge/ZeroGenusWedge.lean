# Removing genus-zero factors from a vertex wedge

A connected genus-zero factor has the rank profile of a point: the rank of a
divisor is its degree when that degree is nonnegative, and is `-1` otherwise.
Substitution in the exact vertex-wedge rank formula therefore absorbs the
whole factor into the coefficient of the gluing vertex on the other factor.

This is the zero-genus reduction needed at the endpoints of the balancing
argument in Corollary 6.16(2) of the banana-graph paper.
