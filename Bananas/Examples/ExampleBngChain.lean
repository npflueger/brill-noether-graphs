# Example 1.15: an explicit genus-eight Brill--Noether general chain

The five factors, in the order the paper lists them:

* the cycle `B_{3,1}` (torsion order `k = 4`);
* the evenly marked theta graph `θ_{4,1,4}`, marked at `(x_1, z_1)`
  (`k = 4`);
* the cycle `B_{3,2}` (`k = 5`);
* the evenly marked theta graph `θ_{5,2,10}`, marked at `(x_2, z_4)`
  (`k = 5`);
* the evenly marked theta graph `θ_{6,2,3}`, marked at `(x_4, z_2)`
  (`k = 3`).

Each factor's `k`-general transmission comes from `cycle_kGeneralTransmission`
(Example 1.11, `Bananas/CycleTorsionOrder.lean`) or
`evenlyMarkedTheta_kGeneral` (`Bananas/EvenlyMarkedThetaKGeneral.lean`). The
genera are `1, 2, 1, 2, 2`, summing to the paper's genus `8`, and the minimum
prefix/suffix budget of Corollary 6.16(2) checks out by direct computation:
`min(1,8) < 4`, `min(3,7) < 4`, `min(4,5) < 5`, `min(6,4) < 5`,
`min(8,2) < 3`. (`FORMALIZATION_NOTES.md` records that the paper's own displayed torsion
orders `4,5,5,5,3` disagree with its per-factor computations `4,4,5,5,3`;
the `k`-values used here are the correct per-factor ones, and the conclusion
is unaffected either way.) -/
