# The endpoint rank-one criterion for banana graphs

The paper proves `lem-BananaRDS` by invoking Luo's characterization of a
rank-determining set: it is enough to show that a divisor has rank at least
one whenever subtracting either member of the proposed set leaves a winnable
divisor.  The imported chip-firing library does not currently define
rank-determining sets or contain Luo's characterization.  This file proves
the complete banana-specific input to that characterization.

The proof uses the already formalized endpoint/semibreak normal form.  The
left endpoint test forces the unrestricted left coefficient to be positive.
If the Riemann--Roch term does not already give rank one, the right endpoint
test forces the bounded right coefficient to be positive as well.

/-- TeX label: `lem-BananaRDS` (Lemma 2.21), banana-specific rank-one
criterion used with Luo's rank-determining-set characterization.

If subtracting either multivalent endpoint from a divisor leaves nonnegative
rank, then the original divisor has rank at least one.  This is exactly the
graph-specific assertion proved in the paper after the reduction to rank one;
packaging it as the full rank-determining-set statement only requires the
currently absent generic definition and Luo equivalence. -/
