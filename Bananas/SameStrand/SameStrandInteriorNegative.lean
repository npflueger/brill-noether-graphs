# Same-strand interior witnesses in arbitrary genus

This is the same-strand branch of the corrected Theorem 3.9.  The paper
refers back to the theta calculation, but the witness and its four rank
values are in fact genus-independent once there are at least three strands.

For normalized interior coordinates `i < j`, put `k = j - i` and
`D = v_i + v_k`.  The pair `v_i + v_k` is non-reflected and has rank zero;
after deleting `v_j` it slides to one of the two endpoint chips.  The two
other deletions are respectively one chip and a nonprincipal degree-zero
divisor.  Thus `rankDelta D = -1`.

/-- Corrected Theorem 3.9, same-strand interior branch.

On a banana of genus at least two, any two distinct normalized interior marks
on one strand admit the explicit negative-rank-difference witness
`D = v_i + v_(j-i)`.  The theorem is stated for genus at least two because
that is the natural range of the rank calculation; Theorem 3.9 uses it with
`3 ≤ g`. -/
