# Second distinct-strand witness in Theorem 3.9

This file proves the second explicit rank witness from the distinct-strand
case of corrected Theorem 3.9.  In normalized coordinates the second mark is
the penultimate point of its strand, while the first mark is not the first
interior point.  The extra hypothesis `2 < B.length beta` excludes precisely
the corrected length-two midpoint exception; without it the theorem is false.
