# Rank-zero part of the cross-strand witness in Theorem 3.9

The first divisor in the distinct-strand proof of Theorem 3.9 is reduced,
after a path-pair slide, to a core chip plus a two-strand semibreak.  This file
records the normal-form calculation abstractly, so the eventual case split
does not need to unfold a concrete banana divisor.
