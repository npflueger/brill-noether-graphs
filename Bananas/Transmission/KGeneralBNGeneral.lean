# Large-period general transmission implies Brill--Noether generality

This is Proposition 6.1 (`prop:kgt-bngenl`) of the paper.  The paper writes
the threshold as `k ≥ g / 2 + 1`.  For natural-number parameters its exact,
parity-independent form is `g + 2 ≤ 2 * k`.

The proof separates the graph theory from the combinatorics.  The two rank
formulas of `lem:tauChars` identify a rectangular family of crossing
inversions.  If that family has more than `g` members, two normalize to the
same `k`-inversion.  The interval between those representatives then supplies
at least `2k - 1` distinct `k`-inversions, contradicting the defining bound.

Every banana of genus at least three is not Brill--Noether general: its

is `2 - g < 0`.  This formalizes the final observation in the introduction. -/
