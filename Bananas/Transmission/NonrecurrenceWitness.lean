# Explicit witnesses of recurrence

The paper's recurrence arguments repeatedly exhibit two distinct nonzero
torsion residues at which the same degree-one vertex twist is effective.
This small generic lemma packages that final finite-residue step.

/-- Two distinct nonzero effective twists of one vertex disprove
nonrecurrence.  The residue `1` is singled out because it is the one that
arises from the other marked vertex in the vertex-wedge argument. -/
