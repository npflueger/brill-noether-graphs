# Arithmetic balancing cuts for mixed-torsion chains

The prefix genus of a chain is nondecreasing and its suffix genus is
nonincreasing.  For a chain with at least two positive-genus factors, the
prefix is strictly smaller than the suffix at the first factor, while the
reverse strict inequality holds at the last factor.  The first crossing
therefore gives a nonempty split satisfying `ChainDominatesAtSplit`.

This is the finite arithmetic step used in the proof of Corollary 6.16(2).
Genus-zero factors are deliberately handled separately by
`ZeroGenusWedge`: strict positivity is used here only to keep both sides of
the balancing cut nonempty.
