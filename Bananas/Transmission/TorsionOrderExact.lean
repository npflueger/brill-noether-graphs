# Exact torsion order from `k`-general transmission

Paper source: `lem:kgtImpliesTorsionOrder` (Lemma 4.2).  A twice-marked graph
with `k`-general transmission has `k` *equal* to its torsion order, not
merely divisible by it (`TorsionWitness M k`, which is already `hK.1`, only
records divisibility).

The proof follows the published argument: using the transmission permutation
`τ` of the zero divisor, `τ 0 = 0` (from `r(0) = 0` and two negative-degree
rank vanishings), and Riemann-Roch identifies a set `A` of exactly `genus`
many negative integers `a` with `τ a > 0`, each giving a distinct ordinary
inversion `(a, 0)`.  Since `k`-general transmission bounds the number of
`k`-inversions by the genus, these `genus`-many inversions already exhaust
`Inv_k(τ)`; periodicity at any further torsion witness `n` then produces a
new inversion `(a + n, n)` whose normalization forces `k ∣ n`.

/-- Paper source: `lem:kgtImpliesTorsionOrder` (Lemma 4.2).

`k`-general transmission forces `k` to be the *exact* torsion order.

Two hypotheses beyond `KGeneralTransmission` are needed, and both are
genuine (not merely convenient) restrictions:

* `huv : M.u ≠ M.v`.  At the diagonal marking `u = v`, every positive `k` is
  a `TorsionWitness` (`TransmissionAPI.torsionWitness_diagonal`), so
  minimality can fail without distinctness.
* `hg : 0 < genus M.graph`.  At genus `0`, Riemann-Roch forces
  `rank D = max (deg D) (-1)` for *every* divisor `D` (since
  `deg (canonical_divisor - D) < 0` whenever `deg D ≥ 0`), which makes every
  transmission permutation a pure shift with no inversions at all. In that
  case `KGeneralTransmission M k` holds simultaneously for *every* positive
  `k` (the inversion bound `≤ 0` and the periodicity clause are both
  vacuous, and the torsion condition is automatic since the Jacobian is
  trivial), so `k` is never pinned down to the torsion order `1`.  The paper
  implicitly works with graphs of nontrivial genus throughout this section;
  this hypothesis makes that explicit.

`hconn : graph_connected M.graph` is also required, matching the
connectivity hypothesis already threaded through
`exists_affine_transmission_of_allSubmodular` and the Riemann-Roch API. -/

/-- TeX label: `lem:kgtImpliesTorsionOrder` (Lemma 4.2).

`k`-general transmission forces `k` to be the *exact* torsion order of
`(G, u, v)`, not merely a period that annihilates `u - v`
(`KGeneralTransmission.to_torsionWitness` already gives that weaker fact for
free).  The full mechanized argument is `KGeneralTransmission.isTorsionOrder`
above; this is a thin restatement at the `mark` API used by the rest of the
library.

Two hypotheses beyond the paper statement are required — see the docstring
of `KGeneralTransmission.isTorsionOrder` for why both are genuine gaps in a
literal reading of the lemma (not artificial strengthenings): `hconn`
(connectivity, needed for the Riemann-Roch input used throughout this
section) and `hg` (positive genus, since at genus `0` every positive `k`
satisfies `KGeneralTransmission` simultaneously, so `k` is never pinned to
the torsion order `1` there). `huv` matches the paper's own distinctness
convention (`FORMALIZATION_NOTES.md`, "Distinctness of the two marks"); the diagonal
marking `u = v` has a `TorsionWitness` at *every* period
(`torsionWitness_diagonal`), so minimality can fail without it. -/
