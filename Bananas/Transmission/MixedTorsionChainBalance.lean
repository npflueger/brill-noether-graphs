# Balanced chains with mixed torsion orders

This file formalizes the second half of Corollary 6.16 (`thm:bngChain`).  A
chain is split at one of its separating vertices.  The factors on the left
obey the prefix-genus bounds of part (1), while the factors on the right obey
the corresponding suffix-genus bounds.  The right half is built from the
outside inward after swapping both marks of every factor.  Thus the suffix
bounds become the prefix bounds needed by Theorem 6.6.

The final graph is presented by its *central* vertex wedge.  This is a literal
iterated vertex gluing of the factors in their original order; choosing this
parenthesization avoids identifying the different nested `Sum` vertex types
of left- and right-associated `MarkedGraph.chain` constructions.
