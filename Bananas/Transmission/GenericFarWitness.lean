# A generic cross-strand far-mark rank witness

The corrected high-genus ledger separates the local rank calculation from the
global far-mark classification.  This file records the local calculation in
the coordinate language currently supported by `SameStrand`: two positive
chips are interior points on distinct strands, and the third position is an
explicit interior vertex distinct from both.

The conclusion is deliberately a rank pattern, not a `rankDelta` theorem.
The two-chip divisor has rank zero, while deleting the third chip from it
leaves a degree-one divisor of rank `-1`.  This is the verified generic
cross-strand ingredient; selecting that third position from a normalized
"far" hypothesis is a separate orientation/mark-selection bridge.

/-! ## Graph-generic ingredients

Stated for an abstract `CFGraph`.  Doing the rank bookkeeping here rather than
on a concrete banana keeps the unifier away from comparing divisors pointwise
(which unfolds `one_chip` and evaluates `DecidableEq` on the subdivision vertex
type); see the module docstring of `LengthTwoCrossMonotonicity.lean`. -/

/-- A cross-strand two-chip divisor has rank zero when an explicit third
interior vertex makes its one-chip deletion reduced with debt.

The divisor in the second conjunct has two positive chips and one deleted
chip, i.e. it is the three-term witness used by the far-mark argument.  The
hypotheses name all vertex distinctness needed by the reducedness theorem;
no endpoint coordinate pair is treated as unique.
