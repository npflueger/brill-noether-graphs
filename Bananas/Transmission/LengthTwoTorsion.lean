# Exact torsion of two length-two midpoint marks

The exceptional high-genus all-submodular marking has torsion order two.  This
is independent of the number of other strands: each midpoint doubles to the
same endpoint pencil.

/-- `TorsionWitness` for an explicitly marked graph, with the structure
projections reduced away.  Rewriting with this before touching the witness
keeps every divisor typed at `CFDiv G` rather than at the defeq-but-distinct
`CFDiv (mark G u v).graph`; otherwise `simp` lemmas such as `one_zsmul` fail
to fire, because the `SMul` instance recorded in the term mentions
`(mark G u v).graph`. -/
