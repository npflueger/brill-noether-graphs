# Reusable transmission API checks

This file is deliberately disjoint from `Statements.lean`.  It records the
mechanical consequences of the present contracts, and separates those from
the geometric/non-recurrence input used by the evenly-marked theta theorem.

/-! ## The present torsion contract is not an exact-order contract

Paper sources: `def-EA` / `def-tauD` and the exact-order implication
`lem:kgtImpliesTorsionOrder`.

/-- A torsion witness propagates to every positive multiple of its period.

This is intentionally stated for the current `TorsionWitness` definition:
it proves that the predicate records an annihilating period, not minimality.

/-- In particular, the diagonal marking has a witness at every positive
period.  This exposes why distinctness and minimality cannot be inferred
from `TorsionWitness` alone.

/-! ## Affine transmission consequences -/

/-- The finiteness conjunct in `KGeneralTransmission` is automatic once its
positive witness and affine-period conjunct are available. -/

  exact kInversions_finite_of_isKAffine hk.1 hAffine

/-- Paper source: `def-tauD` and `def-inv`.

A `KGeneralTransmission` package contains, for every divisor, an affine
transmission permutation with the expected inversion bound.  The finite-set
field is reconstructed from the other fields, so downstream APIs need not
carry it as an independent hypothesis.

each submodular divisor from a torsion witness.  This is the mechanical
transmission step needed before any theta-specific inversion count. -/

/-! ## Exact contract boundary -/

/-- The current definition of `KGeneralTransmission` does not by itself
expose an `IsTorsionOrder` result.  This is a deliberately explicit boundary:
the paper's exact-order lemma needs a separate proof using the rank/inversion
count at `D = 0`, not a definitional simplification of this predicate.

/-! ## Negative rank-difference obstruction -/

/-- A single negative marked second difference rules out `k`-general
transmission, independently of the period and inversion-count clauses. -/
