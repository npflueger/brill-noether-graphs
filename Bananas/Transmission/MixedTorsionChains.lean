# Chains with mixed torsion orders

This file formalizes the first half of Corollary 6.16 (`thm:bngChain`).  The
factors are bundled with their individual periods and `k`-general transmission
hypotheses.  `ChainPrefixBudget g L` is the recursive form of the paper's
condition

`k_i > g₁ + ... + gᵢ`.

Starting from an accumulated graph of genus `g`, its first conjunct says that
the next period is larger than `g` plus the genus of the next factor; its tail
then uses that enlarged genus.  This presentation follows the left-associated
recursion in `MarkedGraph.chain` and avoids any indexing conventions.

/-- Inductive engine for Corollary 6.16(1).  The accumulated twice-marked
graph is already once-marked Brill--Noether general at its right mark; attaching
factors whose periods satisfy the successive prefix bounds preserves that
property.

The extra left mark is retained only because Theorem 6.6 uses it to compose
the exact transmission permutations. -/

/-- Corollary 6.16(1), the once-marked mixed-torsion chain theorem.

The head inequality is the `i = 1` case of the paper's hypothesis, and
`hTailBudget` contains all later prefix inequalities.  Every factor has its
own period and `k`-general transmission; no common torsion order is assumed. -/
