# Gonality forced by `k`-general transmission

The Hurwitz--Brill--Noether consequence needed here is considerably smaller
than the full splitting-type census.  If a divisor `D` has degree `d < k`,
then `D - k u` has negative degree.  In the transmission permutation of `D`
this says that the deeper southeast quadrant is empty.  Hence the dots in the
ordinary southeast quadrant occupy distinct residue classes modulo `k`, and
normalizing the full northwest-by-southeast rectangle gives an injection into
the `k`-inversions.

Together with the defining inversion bound, this excludes rank-one divisors
of degree below `k` whenever `k` is at most the generic gonality.  The reverse
inequality is the elementary observation from Pflueger--Solomon Lemma
`lem:Fg1k`: affine periodicity applied to the transmission permutation of the
zero divisor gives a rank-one divisor `k u`.

/-- If the deeper southeast quadrant is empty, normalization is injective on
the rectangle of inversions crossing the origin.  The point is that a
collision would put two southeast dots in the same residue class; translating
the lower one by affine periodicity would then put a dot in the forbidden
deeper quadrant. -/
