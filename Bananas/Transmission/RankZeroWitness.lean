# Negative rank differences at rank zero

This is the rank-theoretic part of Lemma 3.1(2) in the paper.  The paper
phrases it using supports of a chosen effective representative; the intrinsic
form below avoids choosing representatives and is exactly what the later
reduced-divisor calculation consumes.

/-- At rank zero, a negative marked second difference says precisely that
each one-chip deletion remains winnable while the two-chip deletion is not.
This formulation is invariant under changing the divisor within its linear
equivalence class. -/
