# Corrected Theorem 1.16

The published `thm:bananaSimple` claims that a banana marking has a
non-submodular divisor whenever one mark is at distance at least two from
both multivalent vertices.  The corrected Theorem 3.9 shows that this is
false: the other mark may be the midpoint of a distinct length-two strand.
In that case every divisor is submodular, no matter where the first interior
mark lies.

This module records the sharp corrected statement.  A normalized coordinate
`p` is far from both endpoints when `2 ≤ p.val` and
`p.val + 2 ≤ B.length alpha`.  If either mark is far, then either the other
mark is the midpoint of a distinct length-two strand, or an explicit divisor
has negative marked rank difference.
