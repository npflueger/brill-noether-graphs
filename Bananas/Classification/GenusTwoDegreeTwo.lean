# Degree-two divisors on a connected genus-two graph

These coordinate-free Riemann--Roch facts are the algebraic core needed for
the theta transmission-characterization proposition in Section 4.  Keeping
them at an abstract graph prevents later theta proofs from unfolding concrete
subdivision vertices during divisor algebra.
