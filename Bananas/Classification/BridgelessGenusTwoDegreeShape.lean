# Degree shapes of bridgeless genus-two cores

The topological-vertex bound reduces a bridgeless genus-two graph to one of
two numerical possibilities.  This file records the corresponding exact
valence shapes.  It is deliberately independent of any bivalent-suppression
construction: those shapes are invariants of the original graph as well.
