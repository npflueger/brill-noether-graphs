# General transmission in genus one

The periodic assembly of the three row formulas in `GenusOneRankDelta`: an
exact principal residue gives a translated affine simple reflection, while no
principal residue gives a translation.  The resulting inversion bounds are
already checked in that module, so this file is composition and case analysis.

The shape of the argument, for a fixed divisor `D`:

* submodularity supplies a transmission permutation `τ`, affine at the torsion
  witness (`exists_affineTransmissionPermutation_of_submodular`);
* if no degree-zero member of the marked twist orbit is principal, `τ` is a
  translation and has no inversion classes at all;
* otherwise fix a principal index `c`.  At an exact torsion order the principal
  indices are exactly `c` mod `k`, so `τ` lowers the row at `c`, raises the row
  at `c - 1`, and is the ordinary translated identity everywhere else.  That is
  precisely `affineReflection k (c-1)` translated by `1 - deg D`, which has at
  most one inversion class.

The `k = 1` case is separated out because `affineReflection` needs `2 ≤ k`.
There every index is principal, so `τ` is again a translation.
