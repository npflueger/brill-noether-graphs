# Degree-one classes on a bridgeless graph

This formalizes Lemma 2.3 of the paper using `TwoEdgeCutCondition` as the
precise no-bridge hypothesis.  A nontriviality hypothesis is stated
explicitly: for the one-vertex edgeless graph the cut condition is vacuous,
but its unique degree-one class has rank one rather than rank zero.
