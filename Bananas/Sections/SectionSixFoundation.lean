# Unconditional transmission gluing for Section 6

`ChainGluing.lean` predates the proof of bounded Demazure factorizations and
therefore exposes its chain result with an explicit factorization hypothesis.
`DemazureFactorization.lean` now proves precisely that input for all
nonnegative genus budgets.  This file records the resulting unconditional
version, which is the transmission-existence backbone of the Section 6 chain
arguments.

/-- The outer marks of an iterated vertex-gluing chain have transmission
existence whenever every factor does.  No additional Demazure-factorization
hypothesis remains: it is discharged by
`transmissionExistence_vertexWedge_opposite`. -/

/-- The once-marked existence consequence of the unconditional chain gluing.
This is the currently formal transmission counterpart of the first conclusion
of the paper's chain theorem; the remaining Section 6 work is to prove the
paper's *upper* Weierstrass-size Brill--Noether generality conclusions. -/
