# Theorem 3.9 and the tricycle gap

The lower half of van Dobben de Bruyn–Smit–van der Wegen's Theorem 3.9 —
`dgon(G) ≥ 6` for every *tricycle* graph, i.e. every subdivision of `T_m` whose
three transition edges are **not** subdivided — and the assembly of the
counterexample.

Given Lemma 3.6, the argument is short.  On a tricycle a chip on a transition
path must sit on a transition vertex, so the outer ring carries exactly three
chips, all on transition vertices, and each cycle carries at most two.  Three is
odd, so some cycle carries exactly one; firing at that cycle's chip-free
transition vertex burns the whole cycle and then leaks one step along the
adjacent transition edge, giving **three** burned transition vertices.  Lemma
3.5(b) charges three chips to the centre and three spoke interiors, but the
centre has two and the spoke interiors have none.

## What is and is not claimed

`baker_subdivision_conjecture_false` refutes Baker, *Specialization of linear
systems from curves to graphs*, Conjecture 3.14(a) at `r = 1` and `k = 2`:
`dgon(σ_k(G)) = dgon(G)` for all `k ≥ 1`.  Conjecture 3.14(b),
`dgon(Γ(G)) = dgon(G)`, follows from (a) by the source's Theorem 1.5
(`dgon(Γ(G)) = min_k dgon(σ_k(G))`), which is **not** formalized here; see
`Utilities/Gonality/GonalityTransport.lean` for why the invariant is named
`regularSubdivisionGonality` rather than `metricGonality`.

/-! ## The gap at the level of an arbitrary `CFGraph`

`regularSubdivisionGonality : CFGraph → ℕ` builds `σ_k` on the *occurrence
presentation* of its argument, which labels vertices and edge occurrences by
arbitrary bijections.  `Tricycle/RegularSubdivisionBridge.lean`
identifies that construction with slot scaling for a unit-length specification,
which lets the whole statement be made without mentioning `Spec`. -/

presentation of `T_m` rather than on the tricycle core. -/

Baker, *Specialization of linear systems from curves to graphs*,
Conjecture 3.14(a): `dgon_r(σ_k(G)) = dgon_r(G)` for every connected loopless
multigraph `G`, every `r ≥ 1` and every `k ≥ 1`.  It fails already at `r = 1`
and `k = 2`, on the minimal tricycle. -/
