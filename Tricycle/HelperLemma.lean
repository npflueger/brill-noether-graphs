# Lemma 3.5 of van Dobben de Bruyn–Smit–van der Wegen

Part (a) is proved in full generality in `Utilities/Gonality/BurnedSet.lean`
(`not_mem_burned_of_qReduced`): a positive-rank `q`-reduced divisor's own base
point is never burned by a fire started at a chip-free vertex.

Part (b) is the counting half, here specialised to the spokes of the tricycle
core:

> if `I` is a set of spokes whose transition vertices are all burned, then
> `{v₀} ∪ ⋃_{i ∈ I} (interior of spoke i)` carries at least `|I|` chips.

The split is the source's own `I = I₀ ⊔ I₁`.  For `i ∈ I₀` the first vertex up
the spoke is burned; those vertices are distinct across spokes, so `v₀` — which
is *not* burned — pays for all of them at once, giving `|I₀| ≤ D(v₀)`.  For
`i ∈ I₁` the first vertex up the spoke is unburned while the far end is burned,
so the slot has a burned/unburned split and therefore a chip in its interior.
