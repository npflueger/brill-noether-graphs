# Lemma 3.6 and Corollary 3.7

Van Dobben de Bruyn–Smit–van der Wegen, Lemma 3.6: *on any subdivision `H` of
the minimal tricycle, a positive-rank `v₀`-reduced divisor of degree at most `5`
carries exactly two chips on `v₀` and exactly one chip on each transition path.*
Corollary 3.7, `dgon(H) ≥ 5`, is then immediate, and holds for **every** length
vector — which is what makes the left-hand side of the tricycle gap a minimum
over all `σ_k` rather than a bound at one `k`.

## How the bookkeeping is kept linear

The source's regions `Cᵢ` and its closed transition paths overlap. To keep the
chip counting explicit, every count is expressed in the **slot coordinate system** of
`Utilities/Subdivision/SpecBurning.lean` — the seven core-vertex values
`D (coreVertex v)` and the fifteen slot-interior totals `slotInteriorChips D e`.
Each geometric conclusion is then a linear inequality in those twenty-two
integers, the degree identity is one more, and `linarith` finishes.  No `Finset`
union, no inclusion–exclusion.
