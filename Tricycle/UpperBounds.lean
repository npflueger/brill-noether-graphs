# The tricycle upper bounds

Two explicit divisors, both certified through the *core vertices are
rank-determining* theorem `Spec.rank_ge_one_of_forall_mem_coreVertices`
(`Utilities/Foundations/RankDeterminingSet.lean`), which is the repository's
metric-free form of Luo's Theorem 1.6 and is exactly the source's
Corollary 2.13.  Only seven obligations arise — one per core vertex — and each
is a single explicit firing set, checked by `decide`.

* **Proposition 3.3** of van Dobben de Bruyn–Smit–van der Wegen:
  `D₀ = 2·v₀ + Σᵢ (midpoint of transition slot i)` has positive rank on
  `σ₂(T_m)`, so `dgon(σ₂(T_m)) ≤ 5`.
  Firing `Sᵢᶜ` moves exactly four chips: two off `v₀` — *which is why the
  coefficient is `2`, and why `k = 2` and not `k = 1`* — and one off each of
  the two transition midpoints bounding the component `Sᵢ` of
  `σ₂(T_m) ∖ supp D₀` containing the cycle `Cᵢ`.  At `k = 2` a transition
  midpoint is adjacent to both of its transition vertices, so those two chips
  land exactly on `vᵢ⁻` and `vᵢ⁺`.
* **Theorem 3.9, upper half**: one chip on each of the six transition vertices
  has positive rank on `T_m`, so `dgon(T_m) ≤ 6`.

The firing sets and residual divisors are checked directly by the Lean kernel.
