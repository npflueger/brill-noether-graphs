# The chip-free three-chain, generic in the core

This file states one local picture and proves its residual-effectivity
statements once, generically in the core.

**The picture.**  A chip-free path `v₁ — v₂ — v₃` of three core vertices, with
two chip leaves `c₁, c₂` hanging off `v₁`, one chip leaf `c₃` off `v₂`, and one
chip leaf `c₄` off `v₃`.  The six displayed slots are all the slots incident to
`v₁, v₂, v₃`, and `c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄` carry the whole degree-four divisor.

**This is not one of Atanasov--Ranganathan's eleven configurations.**  It is
the natural extension of their configuration 3 -- their "Third" local picture,
a chip-free *edge* with two chip leaves at each end -- from a chip-free path of
length one to one of length two.  Proposition 5.1 of
Atanasov--Ranganathan does not list it, and they never need it: on the row-03
family (Figure 8, scope 3) they avoid it by placing two of the four chips at
*interior* points of edges, at length-dependent positions
(`a = |B5-A5|` along `B3-A3`, and `z = min(b, c)` along `41-43`).  A divisor
supported on core vertices cannot follow that route, and on row 03 no
core-supported degree-four divisor is covered by configurations 2, 3 and 5
alone; the chip-free set is always a path of three or four vertices.  Hence
this file.

**The two profiles.**  A chip must be delivered to each of `v₁` and `v₂` (on
row 03 the third chain vertex is the middle vertex of the mirrored picture, so
`v₃` is never a centre).  Write `m = min |c₁v₁| |c₂v₁|` for the shorter of the
two leaves at `v₁`, and put the two lower chips `c₃, c₄` at height `0`, the
ambient level -- `v₃`, `c₁`, `c₂` and everything off the picture -- at height
`base`.

*End centre* (`v₁`), `endCenter_*`:
```
base = min |v₃c₄| |v₂c₃|
mid  = min |v₂v₃| (min (|v₂c₃| - base) m)
top  = min |v₁v₂| (m - mid)
height v₃ = base,  height v₂ = base + mid,  height v₁ = base + mid + top
```

*Middle centre* (`v₂`), `midCenter_*`:
```
base = min |v₃c₄| |v₂c₃|
low  = min m (min |v₂v₃| (|v₂c₃| - base))
high = min |v₁v₂| (min (|v₂v₃| - low) (|v₂c₃| - base - low))
height v₃ = base,  height v₁ = base + low,  height v₂ = base + low + high
```

Both are nested minima of slot lengths, so every height collapses along with
any slot it spans: the same script therefore works verbatim on every nonloopy
forest face, exactly as in `ConfigurationFive`.

**The shift.**  When `|v₂v₃|` collapses, `v₂` and `v₃` become one class, and
the single incoming chip may sit at either end of that class depending on
whether `base` is attained at `|v₃c₄|` or at `|v₂c₃|`.  The row's chip
bookkeeping therefore carries one extra conditional transfer, `v₃ ⟶ v₂` guarded
by `|v₂v₃| = 0 ∧ |v₃c₄| < |v₂c₃|`; it appears below as the parameter `shift`.
With it in place each profile needs a *two*-branch target owner, not three.

Everything here is stated against an orientation-agnostic `ChainLedger`, so a
row instantiates each statement in whichever direction its core happens to
orient the two slots whose direction varies (`v₁c₁` and `v₂v₃` on row 03).
The one-edge arithmetic itself is `ConfigurationFive`'s and is reused
unchanged.

/-! ## The arithmetic of the nested minima

Everything the four residual statements need about a profile is one bundle of
inequalities and "which argument is attained" disjunctions, proved once.  Each
consumer then `clear`s the two *nested* minimum equations and works with plain
naturals, so no `omega` below re-derives a three-way minimum.  The two single
minima `m = min la lb` and `b = min u s` are left in place on purpose: `omega`
handles one `min` cheaply, and several branches want to split on it directly.

This is the shape `ConfigurationChippedTriangle.bounds`,
`ConfigurationReservoirChain.bounds` and `ConfigurationReservoirPair.bounds`
already use; this file was the one picture in the family still expanding its
minima at every call, and it was the most expensive module on the library's
critical path because of it (measured `7.7 s`, of which the profiler
attributed `9.8 s` of CPU to `omega` across twenty-one calls; `4.2 s` after).

Both bundles are `private`: they are an internal convenience, and every
exported statement in this file is unchanged. -/
