# Brill--Noether existence through genus five

The complete Atanasov--Ranganathan theorem is assembled here entirely inside
the public `LowGenus` library.  Genus four reduces to six closed cubic rows.
Genus five reduces to the sixteen constructions from the source paper and
four bridge rows, all handled by one checked `(2,3)` articulation theorem.
Semantic loops in either genus are discharged uniformly after fossilization
by splitting off a rigid genus-one wedge factor.
