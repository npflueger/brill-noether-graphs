# The Atanasov--Ranganathan construction on row 06, as a guarding set

Row 06 is the *theta with three bananas*: two hub vertices `2` and `3`, joined
by three disjoint handles, each handle a path

```
   2 -- x == y -- 3        (x == y a banana pair of slots)
```

with `(x, y) = (0, 1)`, `(4, 5)` and `(7, 6)`.  The twelve slots are

```
  0, 1 : 0 == 1     2 : 2 -- 0    3 : 1 -- 3
  5, 6 : 7 == 6     4 : 2 -- 7    7 : 6 -- 3
 10,11 : 4 == 5     9 : 2 -- 4    8 : 3 -- 5
```

**The guarding set is `{0, 3, 4, 7}`** -- the hub `3` together with the near
end of each banana.  It leaves chip free the other hub `2` and the far end of
each banana, and each of those four vertices is the centre of a picture that is
already in the configuration library:

* `2` is a **configuration-2 tripod**: its three slots `2, 4, 9` end on the
  three distinct chips `0, 7, 4`;
* `1`, `5` and `6` are each the centre of **AR's sixth picture**, the banana
  tail of `LowGenus/ConfigurationBananaTail.lean`: for the centre `1` the arm
  vertex is `c = 2`, the arm chips are `a = 7` and `b = 4`, the middle slot is
  `2 -- 0`, the banana chip is `d = 0`, and the tail slot `1 -- 3` lands on the
  chip `f = 3`.

This is exactly the decomposition of `GenusFiveRow14`, with the multiplicities
exchanged: row 14 is three tripods and one banana tail, row 06 is one tripod
and three banana tails.  The three banana tails are images of one another under
the handle-permuting symmetry of the core, so the banana argument is written
**once**, parameterized by the centre `1`, `5` or `6`; every lookup table below
is a `Fin 8`-indexed function of that centre and every proof splits on it.

The closing step is not written by hand at all: the four pictures are packaged
as an `AtanasovRanganathan.Guarding.GuardingSet` and
`GuardingSet.closedConstruction` supplies the row's
`ClosedSubdivisionDharConstruction`.

**This replaces the generated fixed cover.**  The eight modules
`GenusFiveRow06Symmetry`, `GenusFiveRow06CoverBase`,
`GenusFiveRow06CoverCells0`--`4` and `GenusFiveRow06FixedCover` give an
independent machine-generated chamber-cover proof of the same theorem.

/-! ## The three banana tails

The three handles are interchangeable, so the banana argument is written once
with the centre as a parameter.  For a centre `c ∈ {1, 5, 6}` the tables below
name the six slots and the four other vertices of AR's sixth picture:

| centre `c` | arms `a`, `b` | middle `2 -- d` | banana `d == c` | tail `c -- 3` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `1` | `4` to `7`, `9` to `4` | `2` | `0`, `1` | `3` |

| `6` | `2` to `0`, `9` to `4` | `4` | `5`, `6` | `7` |

The arm vertex is the hub `2` and the tail chip is the hub `3` in all three. -/
