# AR row 08, assembled

Atanasov--Ranganathan's *seventh* genus-five family.  The paper draws three of
the four sign patterns of `(|e4| - |e3|, |e7| - |e2|)`; the fourth is the image
of the third under the core automorphism `sigma = (0 6)(1 7)(4 5)`, so the row
needs three chamber proofs and one orbit transport.

* chamber 1 (`|e4| ≤ |e3|`, `|e7| ≤ |e2|`) -- `GenusFiveRow08ChamberOne`,
  a `ConfigurationThree` pair on the stem plus two equal-arm banana pairs;
* chamber 2 (`|e3| ≤ |e4|`, `|e2| ≤ |e7|`) -- `GenusFiveRow08ChamberTwo`,
  the chipped triangle plus two equal-arm banana pairs;
* chamber 3 (`|e3| ≤ |e4|`, `|e7| ≤ |e2|`) -- `GenusFiveRow08ChamberThree`,
  the divisor with a double chip, a `ConfigurationThree` pair and the lopsided
  banana pair of `ConfigurationBananaDoubleChip`.

`GenusFiveRow08Symmetry.chamber_covers` moves every length vector into that
three-way disjunction, and `ClosedOrbit.closedConstruction_of_chamber` turns one
chamber proof per disjunct into the statement on the whole closed orthant.
