# The Atanasov--Ranganathan genus-five cubic atlas

This is the public-layer transcription of the sixteen loopless, bridgeless,
topologically trivalent graphs displayed in Figure 8 of Atanasov--Ranganathan.
It contains only incidence data and kernel-checked elementary properties; it
does not assert the classification theorem or any divisor construction.

The vertices `0, ..., 7` follow the TikZ node order.  Parallel TikZ edges are
separate ordered slots.  The source contains stray self-loop draw commands in
the twelfth and sixteenth scopes; both scopes are already cubic with twelve
non-loop edges, so those commands are omitted, as the figure caption requires.

/-! ## Connectivity

All sixteen rows, in one place.  Six of them (`01`, `02`, `04`, `05`, `08`,
`10`) used to be proved locally in the row and chamber files instead — nine
copies in all, because rows `08` and `10` repeated the fact once per chamber —
and `GenusFiveCubicAtlas` re-proved the same six inline.  They were kept out of
here only because touching this file invalidates the forty-six modules that
import it, including every generated cover; the generated covers now build
only in the independent generated checks.

The checker is `connectedCheckFast`
(`Utilities/Subdivision/ConnectedCheckFast.lean`): a union--find fold rather
than an enumeration of all `2⁸` vertex subsets.  Measured on exactly these
sixteen cores, the old `connectedCheck` cost `0.52 s` each and this costs
`0.013 s`. -/
