# Genus-five Atanasov--Ranganathan configuration infrastructure

The eleven local pictures in Proposition 5.1 are not themselves the final
divisors.  For a fixed subdivision, a construction chooses an effective
degree-four divisor and, at every vertex outside its support, identifies one
of the eleven pictures and supplies the corresponding integral Dhar move.

This file packages exactly that checked output.  It deliberately does not
formalize the informal burning-subgraph notation `G_v`: the load-bearing data
is the firing script and effective residual, which is both unambiguous and
what the rank proof actually consumes.

The row constructions are easiest to read when they prove rank semantically

not add a mathematical hypothesis: rank one says that `D - [v]` is winnable
at every vertex, and the definitions of winnability and principality expose
an effective representative and an integral firing script. -/
