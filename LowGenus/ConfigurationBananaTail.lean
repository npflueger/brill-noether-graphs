# Atanasov--Ranganathan's sixth configuration, generic in the core

This is the *sixth* local picture of Atanasov--Ranganathan, Proposition 5.1
(`fig:configurations-for-genus-5`, the scope commented `%Sixth`):

```
   a       b            a, b, d, f carry the four chips
    \     /             c, e are chip free
      \ /
       c
       |                c -- d  is the middle slot
       d
      / \                d == e is a banana (two parallel slots)
      \ /
       e
       |                e -- f  is the tail slot
       f
```

Note on the file name: the AR numbering is not available here, because
`ConfigurationThreeChain.lean` in this directory is the chip-free *three*-chain,
which is not one of AR's eleven pictures at all.  This file is named after
the geometry instead -- the centre sits at the far end of a banana whose near
end carries a chip -- and the docstrings say which AR picture is meant.

**Relation to `ConfigurationFive`.**  Configuration 5 is drawn on the same
underlying graph, with the chips moved: there `e` carries a chip and `d` is
chip free, so the banana runs from a chip-free vertex *into* a chip.  Here it
runs from the chip at `d` *out* to the chip-free `e`, which is what makes the
picture genuinely different: `d` must give away one chip along each of the two
parallel slots, so it has to be refilled along `c -- d`, and `c` in turn along
its two arms.

**Only the `e`-centre profile is proved here.**  On row 14 the other chip-free
vertex `c` of the picture happens to be a configuration-2 tripod as well (all
three of its slots end on chips), so it is covered by `ConfigurationTwo` and
the `c`-centre profile is never needed.  Should a later row need it, it goes
next to `center_nonneg` below.

**The profile.**  Write `m = min |ca| |cb|` and `pq = min |de₁| |de₂|`, and
put the chips `a`, `b`, `f` and everything off the picture at height `0`:
```
E = min |ef| (m + |cd| + pq)      -- height at the centre e
D = min E (m + |cd|)              -- height at the chip d
C = min D m                       -- height at the chip-free c
```
Three nested minima of slot lengths, so every height collapses along with any
slot it spans and the same script works on every nonloopy forest face.

**The shift.**  When `|cd|` collapses, `c` and `d` are one class, and `d`'s two
outgoing banana chips have to be paid for by `c`'s two arms.  The row's chip
bookkeeping therefore carries one conditional transfer `c ⟶ d`, guarded by
`|cd| = 0 ∧ D < E`; it appears below as the parameter `shift`.  With it the
target owner has only two branches: the centre `e`, except when a banana slot
collapses and the tail slot is too long to reach, where the chip sits on `d`.

The one-edge arithmetic is `ConfigurationFive`'s, reused unchanged, and the
orientation ledger extends `ConfigurationThreeChain.ChainLedger` by the one fact the
proofs below need that it does not carry.
