# The Atanasov--Ranganathan construction on row 12

Put one chip on each of `3,4,5,6`.  The remaining vertices `0` and `1` are
centres of configuration-2 tripods, while `2--7` and its four incident arms
form configuration 3 of Atanasov--Ranganathan, Proposition 5.1.

Both local pictures are core generic and live in
`LowGenus/ConfigurationTwo.lean` and
`LowGenus/ConfigurationThree.lean`.  Because each of
those structures names its centres by an explicit `isCenter` table rather
than "every chip-free vertex", row 12 can declare `{0,1}` to be tripod
centres and `{2,7}` to be a configuration-3 pair, and this file only has to
name the row's lookup tables, check the incidence facts, and observe that the
two tables between them cover every chip-free vertex.

/-! ## Combining the two local pictures

The row's closing step lives in `GenusFiveRow12Guarding`, which feeds
`centers_cover` straight into a `Guarding.GuardingSet` and lets
`GuardingSet.closedConstruction` do the rest.  The hand-written composition
that used to stand here -- a `rowDivisor`, two `rfl` bridges to the two
configuration divisors, a chip/centre dispatch, and a call to
`ofReachesCoreClasses` -- was exactly the generic argument, and is retired. -/

/-- The two `isCenter` tables between them name every chip-free vertex. -/
