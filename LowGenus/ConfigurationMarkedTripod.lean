# The tripod centre over a marked script

This is Atanasov--Ranganathan's *second* local picture -- a chip-free core
vertex all three of whose slots end on a chip vertex -- read through the marked
arm ledger, i.e. with **one of the three arms the half of a marked slot**:

```
      A          B          C        A, B, C carry chips
       \         |         /         v is chip free
        p        q        r          one of p, q, r is a half-slot,
         \       |       /           the half from v to an interior chip
          -----  v  -----
```

`ConfigurationTwo` states the same picture against `interpolatedScript`, one
canonical ramp per slot.  AR's first and ninth genus-five families (atlas rows
`01` and `10`) need it when one arm is a *half* of a slot, because their figures
put a chip at an interior point whose offset is another leg's length
(`Utilities/Subdivision/SplitRampScript.lean`).

Nothing about the profile changes: the centre still sits at

```
 h v = min p (min q r),   h = 0 everywhere else
```

and *nothing new is proved about ramps here*.  What a marked arm contributes at
its own end is already `ConfigurationMarkedRow.slotTailForm_of_arm` /
`slotHeadForm_of_arm` -- an ordinary arm of the half length -- and the far half
of a marked slot carries rise `0` and moves nothing.  So the one genuinely new
statement is the centre's **ledger**: with `zeroChip` accounting for a collapsed
arm whose chip has merged into the centre's class, the three arm contributions
already deliver a chip.  That is `centre_ge_one` below, stated through
`ConfigurationMarkedThree.PairLedger` so that each of the three arms may be a
whole slot read from either end (`fwd` / `rev`) or the half of a marked slot.

Compared with `ConfigurationMarkedThree`'s pair, a tripod is *less* work, not
more: `h = min` of three arms has no partner bookkeeping, no `k` indicator and
no collapsed-middle-slot case, so the delivered chip is always charged to the
centre itself and a row needs no `owner` indirection at a tripod.

into the centre's class. -/
