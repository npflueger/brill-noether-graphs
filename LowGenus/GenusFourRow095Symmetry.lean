# The normalization involution of Core 095

The Atanasov--Ranganathan first-family proof normalizes `L₀ ≤ L₅`.
Core 095 has an involution

```
(0 5)(1 4)(2 3)
```

on core vertices.  It exchanges slots `0,5` and `3,8`, fixes the other
slots, and reverses every slot orientation.  This file packages that
involution as an occurrence-preserving subdivision relabeling, so a proof in
the normalized chamber transports to all positive length assignments.
