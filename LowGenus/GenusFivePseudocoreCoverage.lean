# Structural coverage of genus-five pseudocores

A semantic loop in the pseudocore split is a pointed rigid genus-one wedge
factor.  Removing it leaves a connected genus-four base, so the public
genus-four pencil theorem and the generic corrected wedge construction give a
degree-four pencil on the original subdivision.  Thus the finite cubic atlas
only has to handle the loopless pseudocore branch.

/-- In the absence of semantic loops, stability makes the displayed core a
minimum-valence-three core.  Its centipede expansion is a cubic `8/12` core.
The public classifier therefore either supplies one of the sixteen closed AR
constructions, which immediately descends to the original subdivision, or
identifies one of the four explicit bridge rows. -/
