# The Atanasov--Ranganathan construction on row 11

Row 11 is the cube.  Put one chip on the bipartition class `{0, 3, 5, 6}`.
At a chip-free vertex of the other class, interpolate the same negative
height along its three incident arms, choosing that height to be the shortest
arm length.  Every arm consumes at most its endpoint chip and a shortest arm
delivers a chip to the centre.  This is configuration 2 of
Atanasov--Ranganathan, Proposition 5.1.

All four chip-free cube vertices are tripod centres, so the whole
closed-orthant construction comes from `ConfigTwo.closedConstruction`.  The
calculation itself is core generic and lives in
`LowGenus/ConfigurationTwo.lean`, over the base layer in
`LowGenus/ConfigurationCommon.lean` (which is where the
ramp and endpoint lemmas this file used to carry now live).  All this file
does is name the row's lookup tables and check the incidence facts.
