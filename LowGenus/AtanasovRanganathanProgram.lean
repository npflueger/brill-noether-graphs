# A formal interface for the Atanasov--Ranganathan low-genus program

The paper's finite configuration analysis is naturally stated uniformly over
all positive integral subdivisions of a fixed loopless core.  This file gives
that obligation a name and connects it to the public low-genus existence
reduction.

It also closes one infinite genus-five family: a loopless two-vertex core with
six edge slots.  Every such subdivision is a genus-five banana graph, and its
two endpoint chips already have rank one.  Padding that pencil by two effective
chips supplies the critical degree-four divisor.

The remaining work is geometric, not arithmetic: prove the corresponding
`PositiveSubdivisionPencil` assertions for the finitely many loopless cubic
cores, and connect the loop, bridge, and contraction reductions to those core
statements.

/-- The finite geometric genus-five boundary produced by the public
pseudocore normal form.  Each input is a valid loop-aware pseudocore with at
most eight base vertices; the obligation is uniform over every positive
subdivision of its checked loopless split.

This formulation deliberately does not mention the historical numbering of
the sixteen cubic pictures.  A finite catalog theorem may discharge these
quantifiers later, while structural proofs can already handle looped,
separated, and small-core families directly. -/

/-- The fossil and public pseudocore presentation reduce the whole genus-five
critical-pencil theorem to `GenusFivePseudocorePencils`.

Passing to the fossil contracts every pendant tree and every separating
bridge at once.  Its rank and genus agree with the source, and its two-edge
cut condition supplies the leafless hypothesis needed by the pseudocore
presentation.  This replaces the former recursive, one-leaf-at-a-time
load-bearing reduction. -/
