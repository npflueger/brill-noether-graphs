# The common closing step of an Atanasov--Ranganathan closed-face row

Every completed genus-five row ends with the same four moves: the displayed
degree-four divisor reaches every contracted core class, hence has rank at
least one by the closed-face separator theorem, hence is a
`DegreeFourDharPencil`, hence witnesses a
`ClosedSubdivisionDharConstruction`.

Only the middle statement is row specific.  This file packages the other three
once, so that a row's closing theorem is a single application.

/-- **The closing wrapper.**  A family of effective degree-four divisors, one
for each degenerate spec on a fixed connected core, which reaches every
contracted core class, is a closed-orthant AR construction.

The `reaches` hypothesis is stated on an arbitrary `DegSpec` with the two
facts a face proof actually uses: its core is the fixed one, and its
representative map is exactly reachability through the zero-length slots.
That is the shape the row lemmas already have, so each row's tail becomes one
application of this theorem. -/

/-- **The face-indexed closing wrapper.**

`ofReachesCoreClasses` instantiates its `reaches` hypothesis at exactly one
`DegSpec` — the canonical `faceSpec` of the face it is looking at.  Asking for
`reaches` at an *arbitrary* `DegSpec` is therefore strictly more than the proof
uses.  That extra generality is free for a row that builds its script by hand,
and expensive for one that wants to move a picture along a core symmetry: the
symmetry transport (`ClosedOrbit.relabeling`) is a relabeling *between two
`faceSpec`s*, and there is no corresponding datum for a bare `DegSpec` with an
unconstrained representative map.

This variant asks only for the face-indexed statement.  It is the entry point
`Guarding.OrbitGuard` uses; `ofReachesCoreClasses` is unchanged and remains the
entry point for every row that already exists. -/
