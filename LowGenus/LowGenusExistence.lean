# Brill--Noether existence through genus five from the two critical pencils

Atanasov--Ranganathan reduce Brill--Noether existence in genera at most five
to two rank-one statements:

* every connected genus-four graph has a degree-three rank-one divisor;
* every connected genus-five graph has a degree-four rank-one divisor.

This file formalizes that reduction independently of their geometric case
analysis.  In particular, the two inputs below are the exact public boundary
for a direct formalization of their proof.  No marked divisor, contraction
compatibility, or transmission condition occurs here.

The library's `BNExists G r d` uses the equivalent convenient convention
"degree exactly `d` and rank at least `r`".  The dependency's
`brill_noether_conjecture` uses the same convention with the Brill--Noether
inequality exposed as an implication.
