# Finite two-pole data for six genus-five rows

Each row is two connected leafless four-vertex, five-slot factors joined by
two connector slots.  The index `focus : Fin 2` chooses which connector is
first.  The factors are exchanged when necessary to orient that connector
from left to right; the second connector may retain either orientation.

All data below concern finite incidence and canonical-weight tables.  They
contain no rank or length hypotheses.  The source slots are exactly those in
`GenusFiveCoreAtlas`, including the reversed connector in rows 02 and 04.
