# Closed coverage of the six cubic genus-four rows

The canonical classifier returns an occurrence-sensitive relabeling to one of
the six fixed cubic rows.  Closed-face relabeling therefore turns six named
row proofs into the classifier-facing coverage theorem consumed by the public
pseudocore reduction.
