# The Atanasov--Ranganathan construction on row 10

Row 10 is AR's *ninth* genus-five family: a triangle `{0, 1, 2}` with one spoke
from each corner, an apex `3` joining two of the spoke ends, and a banana
`{6, 7}` reached from the other two.

```
 e0 : 0 -> 2   e1 : 2 -> 1   e2 : 1 -> 0            the triangle
 e10 : 0 -> 3   e4 : 1 -> 4   e3 : 2 -> 5           the spokes  a, b, c
 e5 : 3 -> 4   e9 : 5 -> 3                          the apex
 e6 : 4 -> 6   e11 : 5 -> 7   e7, e8 : 6 == 7       the banana
```

The displayed divisor has one of its four chips at
an interior point of a spoke, at an offset equal to another spoke's length.  The
certificate is therefore a *marked* script
(`Utilities/Subdivision/SplitRampScript.lean`), which bends downward
at the chip and lets the chip pay for the kink.

The two displayed scopes are "`a = min(a,b,c)`" and "`b = min(a,b,c)`". The
remaining case, `c = min`, is the image of the second under the core
automorphism `sigma = (1 2)(4 5)(6 7)`.  So exactly the two drawn scopes have to
be proved:

* `GenusFiveRow10ChamberOne` -- `|e10| ≤ |e4|, |e3|`, the mark on `e4`;
* `GenusFiveRow10ChamberTwo` -- `|e4| ≤ |e10|, |e3|`, the mark on `e10`.

Both decompose the five chip-free vertices as one `ConfigurationMarkedTripod`
centre plus **AR's eleventh picture** (`ConfigurationEleven`) on the remaining
four, in the special position `alpha = gamma ≤ beta` that the chamber's two
inequalities supply.  `GenusFiveRow10Symmetry.chamber_covers` and
`ClosedOrbit.closedConstruction_of_chamber` then finish the closed orthant.
