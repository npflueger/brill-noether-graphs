# A banana pair with a double chip at the short end

This is the solid subgraph of Atanasov--Ranganathan's *third* scope for their
seventh genus-five family (atlas row `08`).  It is **not** one of the eleven
pictures of their Proposition 5.1: the closest, the *Fourth*, puts its single
chip on a banana vertex rather than at the end of a leg.  The module is
therefore named for its geometry, following the `ConfigurationThreeChain` /
`ConfigurationBananaTail` precedent.

```
      A                B          A carries one chip, B carries TWO
      |                |          u, v are chip free, joined by a banana
      u ===== v                   |u A| = p,  |v B| = q,  q ≤ p
```

The pair is **lopsided** -- the arms have different lengths -- and the target is
the *far* vertex `u`, the one whose arm is the long one.  With
`par = min m1 m2` the profile is the two nested minima

```
 hv = min (2 * q) p
 hu = min p (hv + par)
```

and **only the double chip makes it possible**: with a single chip at `B` the
far vertex of a lopsided banana pair is unreachable by any script of this shape,
because the arm `v B` can then carry at most one unit of slope while the two
banana slots charge `v` twice.

Three ways `u` gets its chip, which are the three arguments of the two minima:

* `hu = p` -- the arm `u A` is full and delivers;
* `hu = hv + par` with `par > 0` -- the shorter banana slot is full and delivers,
  and `v` pays the two banana chips out of the two it drew along `q`;
* `par = 0` -- the banana has collapsed, `u` and `v` are the same contracted
  class, and the chip is charged to `v` (or, when `q = 0` as well, to `B`
  itself).  That is the `k` parameter below.

The near vertex is where the double chip is spent: `far_partner_nonneg` is the
statement that `v` still balances, and its proof is the only place in the whole
programme where a canonical ramp runs at **slope two** -- `headContribution q 0
(2 * q) = 2`.  The four one-edge facts that needs are proved first.

/-! ## One-edge arithmetic at slope two

`ConfigurationFive`'s ledger bounds every endpoint slope by one in absolute
value, which is right for a divisor with one chip per arm end.  The double chip
allows -- and needs -- slope two on its own arm. -/

/-! ## The two residual statements

Both are stated at the orientation row `08` reads them in: the far arm from its
tail, the near arm from its head.  The mirror orientation is not needed, because
the fourth sign pattern of row 08 is the `sigma` image of the third and is
obtained by transport rather than by a second proof. -/
