# The Atanasov--Ranganathan construction on row 14

Row 14 is `K₃,₃` with the edge `0--1` deleted and replaced by the path
`0 -- 6 == 7 -- 1`, whose middle step is a banana.  The bipartition of the
`K₃,₃` part is `{0,3,5}` against `{2,1,4}`.

Put one chip on each of `0, 3, 5, 7`.  This is exactly the divisor
Atanasov--Ranganathan display for this family (Figure 8 scope 14; the
straightforward-cases figure marks `a = 0`, `d = 3`, `f = 5`, `h = 7` as the
chip vertices), and exactly the divisor of the generated fixed cover.  The
chip-free vertices are `1, 2, 4, 6`, and the paper's own edge patterns split
them as:

* dashed -- vertex `2`, whose three slots end on the chips `0, 3, 5`;
* dotted -- vertex `4`, whose three slots end on the chips `5, 0, 3`;
* plain  -- vertices `1` and `6`, forming AR's *sixth* local picture:
  `3 -- 1 -- 5`, then `1 -- 7`, then the banana `7 == 6`, then `6 -- 0`.

Vertex `1` is read here as a third configuration-2 tripod rather than as the
arm vertex of that sixth picture -- its three slots also end on chips
(`7, 3, 5`) -- which leaves only the far end `6` of the banana to be done by
hand.  So three of the four centres come straight from
`LowGenus/ConfigurationTwo.lean`, and the fourth from
`LowGenus/ConfigurationBananaTail.lean`, which carries
AR's sixth picture generically in the core.

The two families are combined exactly as in `GenusFiveRow12`: each names its
own centres, and between them they cover every chip-free vertex.
