# Public genus-four reduction to six closed cubic rows

After fossilization, a genus-four graph is connected and leafless.  Its
pseudocore has either a semantic loop, which splits off as a rigid genus-one
factor from a genus-three base, or no semantic loops.  In the latter case
stability permits the centipede expansion to a connected loopless cubic core
with exactly six vertices and nine slots.

Consequently the whole genus-four critical-pencil theorem reduces directly to
closed degree-three pencils on connected loopless cubic `6/9` cores.  No
111-row pseudocore catalog is needed by this unmarked proof.
