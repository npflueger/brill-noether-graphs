# One canonical construction for six positive genus-five rows

Two connected leafless genus-two factors carry effective canonical pencils.
The three-case connector lemma reaches the four attachment vertices, and
all other core vertices already carry chips. The finite data choose each
connector in turn; no length chamber or graph-isomorphism certificate is used.

The theorem here concerns positive subdivisions. `GenusFiveTwoPoleClosed`
extends the same weights to contraction faces by discrete specialization.
