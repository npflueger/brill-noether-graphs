# A symbolic pencil for genus-four Core 096 (skeleton)

Row `096` of the genus-four pseudocore catalog is the **necklace of three
bananas**: bananas `β₀ = {v0,v5}` (arcs `e1,e2`), `β₁ = {v1,v4}` (arcs
`e4,e5`), `β₂ = {v2,v3}` (arcs `e6,e7`), joined in a cycle by the three
single slots `e0 : v0–v4` (length `a₀`), `e3 : v1–v3` (`a₁`), and
`e8 : v2–v5` (`a₂`).

The row is already closed (`RowProof.Row096Replacement.rowSolved_row096`) by a
17,705-node replayed Farkas cover in 274 kernel jobs.  This file is the
skeleton of a *symbolic* replacement in the style of
`GenusFourCore099/100/097`, from the divisor rule discovered and empirically
verified on 2026-08-13 (400/400 random positive length vectors, plus a
member-by-member verification of the complete regime-1 pencil on 45/45
vectors; see the accompanying analysis §6 and
auxiliary calculations):

Rotate by the order-three necklace rotation so that `a₀ = max(a₀,a₁,a₂)`,
and write `x = a₀ − a₁ − a₂`.

* **Regime 1 (`x ≤ 0`)**: `D = v0 + v5 + (point on e3 at distance a₀ − a₂
  from v1)`.  The pencil is the level set of the conserved quantity
  `τ = j + k + m = a₀`: one chip on each single slot at distances `j, k, m`
  from `v0, v1, v2` respectively, every such configuration with
  `j ≤ a₀, k ≤ a₁, m ≤ a₂` being equivalent, together with the six
  full-arc reflection families hanging off the three configurations where
  the two chips flanking a banana reach its endpoints.  Coverage is
  immediate interval arithmetic; the window `[max aᵢ, min (aᵢ+aⱼ)]` for
  `τ` is nonempty exactly by the triangle inequality.
* **Regime 2 (`x > 0`)**: `D = v0 + v5 + (point on the longer arc of β₂ at
  distance min(x, shorter arc length) from v3)` (after the arc swap of
  `e6/e7`, "longer arc = e6").

Every equivalence needed is an instance of the public `RampData` machinery in
`Utilities.Subdivision.RampScript`, through the single generic primitive `prin_cutRamp`
below: the Laplacian of a ramp supported on the slots crossing a cut moves one
chip by `t` along each of them.  Both regimes are cut marches only — no capped
reflections are needed, because the *anchor-only* route (the embedded core
vertices are a strong separator, so
`Certificate.CoreVertexReachability.bnExists_of_reaches_coreVertices` upgrades
reachability at the six core vertices to `rank ≥ 1`) removes the nine-slot
interior sweep from the obligation.  The "banana relay" of regime 2 is the
three-slot instance of `prin_cutRamp` at the cut `{e0,e6,e7}`.

This file is complete: no `sorry` remains.

/-! ## Chip bookkeeping and the two-slot march

All the regime-1 marches are instances of a single generic move: a ramp whose
sign vector is supported on two slots, `-1` on one and `+1` on the other.  Its
Laplacian carries one chip forward by `t` along the first slot and one chip
back by `t` along the second, so it preserves the total depth `τ`.  Proving
that once, for an arbitrary spec, is what keeps the rest of this file short.

The two `one_chip` readings below are stated with *nested* conditionals rather
than conjunctive ones on purpose: `split_ifs` treats a conjunction as a single
atom, so the conjunctive form makes the case split in `prin_twoSlotRamp`
exponentially larger than it needs to be. -/

/-- **The cut march**, in full generality.

Let the sign vector of a ramp be supported on a finite set `A` of slots, each
of which has room for the whole window.  Then the Laplacian of the ramp is,
slot by slot, `sgn e` times the move of one chip from path position `lo e + t`
*back* to `lo e`.  (So `sgn e = +1` pulls a chip backwards and `sgn e = -1`
pushes it forwards; that is the convention forced by `rampSlope`.)

`A` is typically the set of slots crossing a cut of the core, and then the
signs are the coboundary of the side indicator — see `cutSgn`/`rampData_cut`.
The regime-1 marches use two-slot cuts (`prin_twoSlotRamp` below); the
regime-2 banana relay uses the three-slot cut `{e0, e6, e7}`.

The path positions are taken as arguments constrained by their `.val` rather
than built from `lo` and `t` inside the statement, so that no `omega` proof
terms get buried in the `Fin` literals. -/

A ramp whose sign vector is `-1` on `α`, `+1` on `β` and zero elsewhere has a
Laplacian that carries one chip forward by `t` along `α` and one chip back by
`t` along `β`.  The two displacements cancel, so any total depth summed over
the active slots is conserved — which is the whole content of the regime-1
pencil.

This is `prin_cutRamp` at the two-element set `{α, β}`.

/-! ## The `τ`-family and the three regime-1 marches

Write `a₀ = length 0`, `a₁ = length 3`, `a₂ = length 8` for the three single
lengths.  The `τ`-family carries one chip on each single slot, at depths
`j, k, m` measured from `v0, v1, v2`; the two-slot marches below all preserve
`τ = j + k + m`, so the whole level set `τ = a₀` is one equivalence class.

Every march is a *cut* march: its potential is `t` on one side of a two-slot
cut of the necklace and `0` on the other, which makes `RampData.potential`
automatic. -/

/-! ## The single regime-1 obligation

`bnExists_regime1` is reduced to *one* statement: that the pencil reaches the
six core vertices.  Nothing about interior vertices is needed.

That is the anchor-only route back-ported into
the accompanying analysis from the row-proof-format branch:
the embedded core vertices are a strong separator of any positive
subdivision, so `Certificate.CoreVertexReachability.bnExists_of_reaches_coreVertices`
upgrades reachability at the core to `rank ≥ 1` outright.  The capped
reflections that sweep the nine slots are needed only to *exhibit* the pencil,
not to prove the rank statement — which is what makes this proposal much
smaller than the row-100 file it is modelled on.

Stated against `IsNecklace` rather than the catalog row so the marches can be
developed for an arbitrary spec. -/

* the six core vertices are covered by just **three** members of the level set
  `j + k + m = a₀`:
  - `v0`, `v5` : `T(0, a₀ − a₂, a₂)`, the pencil itself;
  - `v1`, `v2`, `v4` : `T(a₀, 0, 0)` — chips at the head of `e0` (`= v4`, by
    `hn.h0`), the tail of `e3` (`= v1`, `hn.t3`) and the tail of `e8`
    (`= v2`, `hn.t8`);
  - `v3` : `T(a₀ − a₁ − m, a₁, m)` with `m = min a₂ (a₀ − a₁)`, whose middle
    chip is at the head of `e3` (`= v3`, `hn.h3`).  The bounds need
    `a₁ ≤ a₀` (`hmax₁`) and `m ≤ a₀ − a₁` (from the `min`).

The marches themselves are now proved: `march_A`, `march_B` and `march_C`
above realize exactly the three equivalences this needs.  What is left is
purely the coverage bookkeeping — instantiate the marches at the six vertices
and identify the endpoints via `pathVertex_zero`/`pathVertex_length` and the
`IsNecklace` fields — together with the two degenerate cases that the marches
carry as hypotheses:

* `a₂ = a₀`: march B is vacuous, and march A alone already lands on
  `T(a₀, 0, 0)`, so `v1, v2, v4` are still covered.
* `a₀ = a₁ + a₂` (the triangle boundary): march C is vacuous, but there
  `a₀ − a₂ = a₁`, so the pencil's own middle chip already sits on
  `pathVertex 3 a₁ = v3`.

Chaining A and B uses `prin` additivity: the script is `scriptA + scriptB` and
`map_add` splits its Laplacian.

Note the interior slots need no attention at all: by the strong-separator
route this lemma is the whole obligation. -/

/-! ## Regime 2: the banana relay

Regime 2 is `x = a₀ − a₁ − a₂ > 0` in the chart where `a₀` is a longest single
and `e6` is the longer arc of `β₂`.  Write `s = min(x, a₇)`; the divisor is

    D = v0 + v5 + (point on e6 at distance s from v3).

The pencil is a single chain of marches, all of them cut marches with the chip
on `e0` advancing, and the sides forming an increasing chain

    {v0,v5} ⊂ {v0,v2,v5} ⊂ {v0,v2,v3,v5} ⊂ {v0,v1,v2,v3,v5}

as the two trailing chips walk backwards around the necklace `v5 → v2 → v3 →
v1 → v4`.  Crossing the banana `β₂` is the "relay": the parked chip on `e6`
and the arriving chip (now on `e7`) advance *together*, which is the
three-slot cut `{e0,e6,e7}`; crossing `β₁` at the end is the three-slot cut
`{e0,e4,e5}`, i.e. the star of `v4`.  The chain, with the `e0` depth in
brackets:

    [0]      v0 + (e6 at a₆−s) + v5
    [a₂]     · + (e6 at a₆−s) + v2            (cut {e0,e8})
    [a₂+s]   · + v3 + (e7 at s)               (cut {e0,e6,e7}, the relay)
    [a₂+s+a₁] · + (e7 at s) + v1              (cut {e0,e3})

which already covers `v0, v1, v2, v3, v5`.  For `v4`, put `r = x − s`.  If
`r = 0` the last configuration already has its `e0` chip at `v4`.  Otherwise
`s = a₇`, so the chip on `e7` is a second chip at `v3`; one more `{e0,e3}`
march of length `min(a₁, r)` either lands the `e0` chip on `v4` or leaves two
chips at `v1`, and then the star march at `v4` delivers a chip to `v4`
whichever of its three slots runs out first. -/
