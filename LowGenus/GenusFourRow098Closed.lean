# Closed genus-four row 098 from its separating vertex

Row 098 is the unique bridge-bearing member of the six loopless cubic
genus-four cores.  Removing vertex `1` separates two genus-two lobes.  The
checked core cut below is independent of edge lengths, and the public
degenerate-cut theorem shows that it survives every nonloopy forest face.

This gives a short structural proof on the whole closed orthant; the generated
`g4row098.rpf` cut-vertex certificate is therefore no longer load-bearing.
