# The chipped triangle

This is the solid subgraph of Atanasov--Ranganathan's *second* scope for their
seventh genus-five family (atlas row `08`).  It is **not** one of the eleven
pictures of their Proposition 5.1: the closest, the *Eighth*, is a triangle with
three chip arms too, but its triangle is chip **free** and it carries the extra
hypothesis that one arm has length `min` of the other two, which row 08's second
chamber does not supply.  The module is therefore named for its geometry,
following the `ConfigurationThreeChain` / `ConfigurationBananaTail` /
`ConfigurationBananaDoubleChip` precedent.

```
        A            B           A, B, C each carry a chip
        |            |           c carries a chip as well
        u ==== q ====v           u, v are chip free
         \          /            |c u| = p, |u v| = q, |c v| = r
          p        r             |u A| = al, |v B| = be, |c C| = ga
            \    /
              c
              |
              C
```

Four chips in all: one on `c`, one at the end of each of the three arms.  The
target is `u`; the picture is read a second time at `v` by swapping `u ↔ v`,
`al ↔ be`, `p ↔ r`.  The profile is four nested minima,

```
 hc = min ga (min al be)                        -- the chipped vertex
 h0 = min be (hc + r)                           -- the partner, before clamping
 ht = min al (min (hc + p) (h0 + q))            -- the target
 hv = min h0 ht                                 -- the partner
```

The three ways `u` gets its chip are the three arguments of `ht`: its own arm
goes full, or the triangle slot from `c` goes full and `c` refills along `ga`,
or the triangle slot from `v` goes full.

The final clamp `hv = min h0 ht` ensures that the partner does not rise above
the target; this is used in the slot-ledger inequalities below.

**One chip moves inside a contracted class.**  When the triangle slot `c - v`
collapses (`r = 0`) *and* `c` sits strictly above the partner's arm
(`hc < be`), the partner has to pay one unit across `q` that neither its own arm
nor the collapsed slot can supply; `c` and `v` are then the same contracted
class, so `c` lends it the chip it is sitting on.  That transfer is `lend`, and
it is the only allocation the picture needs.

carrying height `x`. -/
