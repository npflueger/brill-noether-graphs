# Atanasov--Ranganathan's eleventh configuration, generic in the core

This is the *eleventh* local picture of Atanasov--Ranganathan, Proposition 5.1
(`fig:configurations-for-genus-5`, the scope commented `%Eleventh`): a triangle
of chip-free vertices closed off by a banana, with one chip arm at each corner
and a fourth chip sitting **on** the near banana vertex.

```
        A1                B1                C1
        | alpha           | beta            | gamma
        A ---- S ---- B ---- u ---- Q ==m₁,m₂== P ---- w ---- C
        |                                                     |
        +------------------- t ------------------------------+
```

Chip-free: the apex `A`, the two banana-side vertices `B` and `C`, and the far
banana vertex `P`.  Chips: the three arm ends `A1`, `B1`, `C1`, and `Q`.  The
slots are `A-B` (`S`), `A-C` (`t`), `B-Q` (`u`), `C-P` (`w`), the banana
`P = Q` (`m₁, m₂`), and the three arms `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`.

The solid subgraph of both scopes of the ninth family (atlas row `10`) is this
picture, in the special position where the apex arm equals the `C` arm. In the
formal script, **the chip on the banana is lifted with the chip-free banana
vertex**: if `Q` stayed at the ambient level
while `P` rose, `Q` would pay one chip along *each* of the two parallel slots
and has only one.  That is the same mechanism as
`ConfigurationBananaTail` (AR's *sixth* picture), and the profiles below mirror
its `E / D / C` nested minima term for term.

## The hypothesis, and its orientation

Everything below assumes

```
 alpha = gamma ≤ beta
```

--- the apex arm equals the `C` arm, and both are at most the `B` arm.  Every
row-10 chamber supplies exactly this: the chamber's first inequality places the
interior chip so that `alpha = gamma = min(a,b,c)`, and its second inequality is
`gamma ≤ beta`.  Only `gamma` appears below, standing for both arms.

The hypothesis is orientation-specific. Row 10 uses only the
`alpha = gamma` orientation, so that is the version stated here.

## The three profiles

Everything off the picture, and the three arm chips, sit at height `0`.  Write

```
 pq = min m₁ m₂            mB = min beta (gamma + S)       G = gamma + w
 E  = min G (mB + u + pq)  D  = min E (mB + u)             C = min D mB
```

for the target-`P` heights --- these are literally `ConfigurationBananaTail`'s
`E / D / C` under the substitution `m ↦ mB`, `|cd| ↦ u`, `|ef| ↦ G`, the far
route being two slots here (`C1 ⟶ C ⟶ P`) because `C` is chip free and carries
its own arm.  Then

```
 targets A and C:  h A = h B = h C = h P = h Q = gamma        (one script, two targets)
 target  B:        h A = h C = h P = h Q = gamma,
                   h B = min mB (gamma + u)
 target  P:        h A = h C = gamma,  h B = C,  h Q = D,  h P = E
```

Every height is a nested minimum of slot lengths, so it collapses along with any
slot it spans and the same script works on every nonloopy forest face, exactly
as in `ConfigurationFive`.

## The shift

When `u` collapses, `B` and `Q` are one class and `Q`'s two outgoing banana
chips have to be paid for out of `B`'s resources.  The row's chip bookkeeping
therefore carries one conditional transfer `B ⟶ Q`, guarded by `u = 0 ∧ D < E`;
it appears below as the parameter `shift`, exactly as in
`ConfigurationBananaTail`.  The other collapses are handled by the row's owner
choice rather than by a transfer: when `S = 0` the apex `A` lies in `B`'s class
and already carries the delivered chip, and when `w = 0` the vertex `C` lies in
`P`'s class and does.

Everything is stated against `ConfigurationMarkedThree.PairLedger`, so a row
instantiates each statement in whichever direction its core happens to orient
the slot, and so that an arm may be the *half* of a marked slot --- which is how
row 10 supplies `alpha = gamma` in the first place.  The one-edge arithmetic is
`ConfigurationFive`'s, reused unchanged.

Both carry a *full* arm of length `gamma` -- that is the whole content of the

across `S` at `A`; `P` across `w` at `C`), and one slot to a neighbour that is
always at the same height (the `A-C` slot `t`, whose two ends carry `gamma` in
every profile). -/

`B` alone rises, to `min beta (min (gamma + S) (gamma + u))`: it may not outrun
its own chip `B1`, may not draw more than the one chip `A`'s full arm delivers,
and may not draw more than the single chip sitting at `Q`.  Whichever of the
three caps is attained is a *full* slot at `B`, so `B` gains a chip. -/

/-! ## The target-`P` profile

Three nested minima, `ConfigurationBananaTail`'s verbatim:

```
 E = min G (mB + u + pq)   -- the far banana vertex P
 D = min E (mB + u)        -- the chip Q
 C = min D mB              -- the chip-free B
```

with `mB = min beta (gamma + S)` -- `B`'s two resources, its own arm or the
apex's full arm followed by the full `A-B` slot -- and `G = gamma + w`, the far
route `C1 ⟶ C ⟶ P`, which is two slots here because `C` is chip free. -/
