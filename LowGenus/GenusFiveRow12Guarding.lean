# Row 12 as a guarding set

`LowGenus/GuardingSet.lean` claims that the closing step of an
Atanasov--Ranganathan row proof is generic: pick a core-supported chip
assignment of degree four, cover every chip-free vertex by library pictures,
and the closed-orthant construction follows.  This file cashes that claim on
the row where the composition is most visible.

Row 12's chip-free vertices are covered by **two different pictures** -- the
AR configuration-3 pair `2--7` and the AR configuration-2 tripods -- and
`GenusFiveRow12.centers_cover` is the row's hand-written statement that
between them they name every chip-free vertex.  Here that same fact is fed
straight into the `guard` field of a `GuardingSet`, and
`GuardingSet.closedConstruction` produces the row's theorem with no further
row-specific work: no divisor bookkeeping, no `fin_cases`, no separator
argument.

`coreClassDivisor_eq_fourChipDivisor` identifies the guarding set's class
divisor with the four-chip divisor the two configuration files display, so this
is a proof about AR's own divisor and not merely a similar one.  As of
2026-08-25 it is the row's **only** proof: `GenusFiveRow12`'s hand-written
`rowDivisor_reaches_coreVertex` / `row12_closedConstruction` tail has been
deleted, and `GenusFiveConstructions.row12_straightforward` points here.
