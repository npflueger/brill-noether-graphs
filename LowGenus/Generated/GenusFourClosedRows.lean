# Generated closed-face checks for genus-four cubic rows

These are the public, kernel-checked fallbacks for the three cubic rows whose
closed-face proofs are represented by `.rpf` certificate trees.  They are not
intended to displace human-readable positive-length arguments:

* row 096 has the symbolic cone-march proof in
  `LowGenus.GenusFourRow096Pencil`;
* row 099 has the hand-written `K₃,₃` pencil retained in the private source
  tree;
* row 100 has its hand-written positive-length construction retained there as
  well.

The generated certificates add the fact needed by the public pseudocore
reduction: the same pencils survive every genus-preserving nonloopy forest
face.  Their Farkas receipts and firing scripts are rechecked by Lean's kernel;
no external checker is trusted.
