# Passive contraction data for the twenty-four proper faces of row 095

The zero-set ledger and its mathematical dispatch live in
`LowGenus.GenusFourRow095Closed`.  This file contains only the repetitive
finite witnesses: for each proper nonloopy forest face, a quotient core,
vertex representatives, surviving slots, and slot reversals.  Every field is
rechecked by the kernel through `decide`.
