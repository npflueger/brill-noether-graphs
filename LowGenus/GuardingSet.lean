# Guarding sets: the abstract glue of an Atanasov--Ranganathan row proof

Read the finished genus-five rows side by side and the same shape appears in
every one of them.  A row fixes a **core-supported chip assignment** and then
shows that every *chip-free* core vertex is the centre of some local picture
from the configuration library; the chip vertices need no argument at all,
because a divisor that already has a chip at `v` reaches `v`.  `GenusFiveRow12`
writes that idiom out in the open: its `centers_cover` says the two `isCenter`
tables between them name every chip-free vertex, and the two pictures'
`reaches_center` lemmas are then glued by hand.

This file names the idiom.  A `GuardingSet` for a core is a nonnegative core
weight of total degree four together with, for each chip-free vertex, a proof
that the induced divisor reaches that vertex on every degenerate spec.  The
main theorem turns one into a `ClosedSubdivisionDharConstruction`, so a row
proof becomes: *exhibit a guarding set*.

## Which rows of the atlas are guarding sets

Thirteen of the sixteen genus-five rows close through `closedConstruction`
below.  The other three cannot, and the reason splits in two:

| rows | status |
|---|---|
| 01, 02, 03, 04, 06, 07, 09, 12, 14 | a `GuardingSet` is the row's proof |
| 11, 13, 15, 16 | one configuration instance covers *every* chip-free vertex, so `ConfigTwo.closedConstruction` / `ConfigThree.closedConstruction` already close them in a line -- see the note below |
| 05 | a core-supported uniform divisor exists (`1_{2,3,4,5}`), but no library picture recognises its chip-free set: two banana pairs with **unequal** arms.  A *library gap* |
| 08, 10 | **no** core-supported degree-four divisor is uniformly rank one.  An interior chip is forced, and no unmarked guarding set can exist at this degree |

The two failure modes are the genus-five instances of
auxiliary calculations §2a, and the classification there was reached
with a rank oracle (direct Dhar reduction), not a certificate-search proxy.
Row 05's entry is a correction: its own docstring used to claim it had no
core-supported divisor at all, and so did row 01's before row 01 was reproved
from `{2, 3, 4, 5}`.

Rows 11, 13, 15 and 16 are *not* converted, and the obstruction is structural
rather than cosmetic: `ConfigTwo` and `ConfigThree` do not require their four
chip vertices to be pairwise distinct -- `chipSum` stands in for that -- so a
generic instance's displayed `fourChipDivisor` need not be the class divisor
of any weight, and `ConfigX.closedConstruction` cannot be re-derived from
`closedConstruction` at the library level.  On those four rows the chips do
happen to be distinct, but paying `coreClassDivisor_eq_fourChipDivisor` to say
so makes the proof longer, not shorter.

Nothing here is new mathematics; it is the statement that the per-row gluing
step is generic.  What that buys is a precise reduction: with this theorem in
hand, Brill--Noether existence for a family of cores is exactly the pure graph
theory question "does every core in the family admit a guarding set?", with no
Dhar arithmetic left in it.  The numerical side of that question is probed in
auxiliary calculations.

## Why the chip side is free

`chip_reaches` below is the whole argument for a vertex that carries a chip:
the class of `v` in the contracted core carries at least the weight of `v`
itself, because all the other weights are nonnegative, so the divisor is its
own effective representative with a chip at `v`.

## Relation to the configuration library

Every configuration file already proves exactly the field `guard` asks for,
one centre at a time and stated against an arbitrary `DegSpec` whose core is
the fixed one and whose representative map is reachability through the zero
slots -- see `ConfigurationTwo.ConfigTwo.reaches_center`,
`ConfigurationThree.ConfigThree.reaches_center`, and the `reaches` lemmas of
the reservoir, banana-tail, chipped-triangle and three-chain files.  The one
adjustment is bookkeeping: those files display their divisor as a
`fourChipDivisor` on four named core vertices, whereas a guarding set carries
a weight function.  `coreClassDivisor_eq_fourChipDivisor` below is that
translation, proved for four pairwise-distinct chips.

/-! ## Translating the library's displayed divisor

The configuration files display their divisor as `fourChipDivisor` on four
named core vertices.  A guarding set carries a weight function instead, so
that "chip free" is a statement about the weight and not about a list.  The
two agree as soon as the four names are pairwise distinct. -/
