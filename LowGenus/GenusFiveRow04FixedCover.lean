/-! **Independent generated check.** This module provides an additional generated proof of row 04 and is not imported by the main `LowGenus` root.

Generated exact replay of the fixed AR row-04 divisor on a
fundamental domain for the core's slot-level symmetry group.

The external discovery data are untrusted: `cells_check` and
`tree_check` replay every arithmetic obligation in the kernel, and the
chamber is discharged by the generated coverage theorem, so the
conclusion is the row on the whole closed orthant. -/
