# Atanasov--Ranganathan configuration 5, generic in the core

Configuration 5 of Atanasov--Ranganathan, Proposition 5.1, is the local
picture at a centre of the length-independent row: two boundary arms, a
middle slot to a second centre, two parallel slots onward to a cycle vertex,
and one far slot closing the cycle.  Two nested minima fix the three heights,
and the whole verification reduces to one-edge arithmetic.

This file carries that arithmetic once, in two layers.  The first is the
one-edge ledger: what one slot contributes at each of its ends, stated for a
slot read from either end -- `tailContribution` at the tail,
`headContribution` at the head -- because a row reads the same picture at two
centres in opposite orientations, and every fact here has a mirror.

The second layer states the residual effectivity at each vertex of the local
picture, once per nested-min profile (`outerTarget_*` when the outer minimum
saturates first, `innerTarget_*` when the inner one does) and once for the
cycle vertex, which both profiles share.  The three slots whose orientation
varies between the two centres -- the two boundary arms and the far slot --
are read through a `SlotLedger`, so each statement covers both orientations;
the middle and parallel slots point the same way at both centres and are
spelled out directly.  A row supplies its lookup tables and the five
height equations; nothing else.

/-! ## The orientation ledger

Row 07 reads the same local picture at two centres.  The middle slot and the
two parallel slots point the same way at both, but the two boundary arms and
the far slot are traversed in opposite directions.  A `SlotLedger` names the
two ends of those three slots, so that the whole calculation below is written
once and instantiated twice. -/

read.  `tail L hu hv` is the contribution at the end carrying height `hu`,
`head L hu hv` the contribution at the end carrying `hv`. -/

`o` is the height at the centre, `i` at the second centre, `e` at the cycle
vertex, and the two nested minima saturate outer-first. -/

/-- Residual effectivity at an outer-target centre.

The two boundary arms get **independent** ledgers: a row whose centre is the
tail of one arm and the head of the other (any core whose local cycle is a
directed one, such as atlas row 09) reads them in opposite orientations.  A row
whose arms point the same way passes the same ledger twice. -/
